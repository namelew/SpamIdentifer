Robert Harley:>It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, >precisely identical between males and females.Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.But that obscures the different modes ofpromiscuity. Both the person who gives sex formoney or power or companionship and the personwho uses money and power and companionship toget sex are promiscuous, in the broadest senseof the word. But their motives and behavior arequite different.Langur monkeys were the example in the citedarticle. "Dominant males .. kill babies thatare not their own." "The dominant male monkey.. seeks to defend his harem of females." Butcozying up to the current dominant male isn'tthe best strategy for female langurs, because"dominant males are dethroned by rivals every27 months or so." "By mating with as manyextra-group males as possible, female langursensure their offspring against infanticide,"by the male who is likely next to rule theroost.Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint apicture of carefree females engaged in joyouslypromiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver whois taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is abetter picture of that. ;-)_________________________________________________________________Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com

BASSEY& ASSOCIATESFALOMO, IKOYI.LAGOS - NIGERIA.FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contentsdoes not meet with your personaland business ethics, I apologize in advance.I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent AlhajiIshmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief securityadvicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in theperson of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country underthe leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come undersevere persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the lastmilitary regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only tothe confines of his village.The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposalthat might be of interest to you. Myclient has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with asecurity company abroad. This fundcame about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client'sportfolio during his tenureas chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was thathe had part of the funds transferredfrom the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfitwith the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personalsecurity outfit of the then president. But before the purchase couldtake place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this forhimself as all his properties has beenconfisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration hecannot travel out and effect thechange of possession to his benefit.I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner thatcan help him facilitate thechange of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed forthe execution of this endeavour are inmy possession.The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six HundredThousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be ofinterest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that wecan go through the rudiments of this endeavour.I remain most obliged.Barrister Williams Bassey (JP).Principal Partner.- Bassey & Associates

Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on Earth today.The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world.>  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does, > however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the > future of the Muslim world.

It's #1 in practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and taking share from every other government broadcaster.It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared they might.As you read, replace "United States" with "Roman Empire" and it may make as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us.Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world.Rohit-----------------------------------------------------September 20, 2002Full Text: Bush's National Security StrategyFollowing is the full text of President Bush's new national security strategy. The document, entitled "The National Security Strategy of the United States," will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of the Administration's policy.INTRODUCTIONTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us.To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn.The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, trade, and cultural advancement.Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders.The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. The United States will deliver greater development assistance through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of AIDS and other infectious diseases.In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission.I. Overview of America's International Strategy"Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom.For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality.That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations with other states, and respect for human dignity.And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.To achieve these goals, the United States will:*	champion aspirations for human dignity;*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends;*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends, with weapons of mass destruction;*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade;*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy;*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power; and*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require different methods, but not different moralities."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police.America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people.Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a stronger, but is a freer and more just society.Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish.Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, the national security strategy of the United States must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international bodies.We will:*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom;*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future; and*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it.III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing."President BushWashington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)September 14, 2001The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some unseen.Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial tools necessary to finish the task.The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative financial networks.However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek.We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or their precursors;*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country; and*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities.We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism. This includes:*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose;*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk; and*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter attack.This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector.This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide.As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terroristsIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small."President BushBerlin, GermanyMay 23, 2002Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability.No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:*	The United States should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge.*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles:The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict.The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state.Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation.Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere.Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country.In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the Colombian people.In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- combating global terror. American interests and American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats.Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region:*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention;*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations; and*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis.Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass Destruction"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and we will oppose them with all our power."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security environment has undergone profound transformation.Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable.But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex and dangerous.In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that, while different in important ways, share a number of attributes. These states:*	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers;*	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;*	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;*	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and*	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it stands.At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations.We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis.Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:*	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed adversaries.*	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward.*	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. We cannot let our enemies strike first.*	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and the wealth of their nations.*	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.*	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to action.For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning.The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction.The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act preemptively.The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather.We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our actions. To support preemptive options, we will:*	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;*	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats; and*	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free Trade."When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively."President BushMonterrey, MexicoMarch 22, 2002A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it reinforces the habits of liberty.We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth, including:*	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;*	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that improve incentives for work and investment;*	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors;*	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use;*	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;*	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and*	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity.The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the developing world.A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth.Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future.We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur.The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.The concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:*	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.*	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free trade.*	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will be our principal focal points.*	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade Promotion Authority.*	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.*	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.*	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets.*	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy "network" between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.*	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies.Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be to:*	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for international cooperation;*	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts;*	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions;*	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;*	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's budget; and*	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path.VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens."President BushWashington, D.C. (Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank)March 14, 2002A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of U.S. international policy.Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's poorest economies within a decade.The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal:*	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms.*	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries.*	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that more children are getting a better education, more people have access to health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do.*	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results.*	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy.*	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.*	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in Africa. The United States can also bring information technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been devastated by AIDS.*	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition.VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war."President BushWest Point, New YorkJune 1, 2002America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world trade.The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:*	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;*	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;*	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces;*	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;*	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; and*	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and friendships, we will:*	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation;*	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer-term;*	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;*	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic environment; and*	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region.We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration into the Euro-Atlantic community.At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even decades.The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future.The United States relationship with China is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness.The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens.Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become more open with information, promote the development of civil society, and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over $100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for relations between the United States and other main centers of global power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive.Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress.IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, and enterprise of our people."President BushWashington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)September 20, 2001The major institutions of American national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be transformed.It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, our military must:*	assure our allies and friends;*	dissuade future military competition;*	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and*	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges.The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment of U.S. forces.Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. infrastructure and assets in outer space.Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States.Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets.We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury.We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement.Initiatives in this area will include:*	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence capabilities;*	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies;*	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage;*	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities; and*	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all-source analysis.As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American readiness to play our part.Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel.We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. personnel and officials.We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security. The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the American people.Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite of it.In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that energy. That is where our national security begins.

Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more sensibly it would have been a lot harder.See "The Code Book" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, "Cryptonomicon" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma cracking story, and pretty accurate.I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you see....Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma machines and brute-forcing.Eirikur

I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They bothdisplay on a "virtual X server" created by vncserver on the homebox.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer whereverI happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and iscarried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.That gives me access to both home and work email from either place without the complications involved in having two copies of exmh working on the same set of folders.It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not so bad that I can't stand it.--Hal_______________________________________________Exmh-users mailing listExmh-users@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85494359Date: Not suppliedAmazing story about the "dabba wallahs" -- India's 112-year-old meal-delivery system that outdoes FedEx using pictograms, bicycles, and largely illiterate (but well-compensated) deliverypeople:     As part of the tiffin distribution process, every day the meals are picked     up from commuters' homes in Mumbai long after the commuters have left for     work, delivered to them on time, then picked up and delivered home before     the commuters return.     Each tiffin carrier has, painted on its top, a number of symbols that     identify where the carrier was picked up, the originating and destination     stations and the address to which it is to be delivered.     After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest     railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination     station.     At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and     re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor.     The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons     and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and     returned when they came.     The system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs, and a single tiffin     box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to     office.

[Paul Moore]>    but let's walk before we run - after all, we may end up>    all using Zodb in any case :-)I'd like this (despite the additional installation burden - we can shipbinaries for Windows and Mac) and not only for technical reasons.  As Iunderstand it, post-1.8x versions of the core bsddb code ship under theSleepycat license, which demands that projects using it must bepublished-source.  This is a problem if we want Spambayes to be fullyPSF-licensed - if someone wants to take the Spambayes source and fund theiraddictions by creating a commercial, closed-source spam-filter product, thePSF license allows that but not if the code relies on bsddb.  Not that I'min favour of people making money from Spambayes (unless it's me 8-) but thePSF license does allow for it - it should be all or nothing.  Or do I havethis all wrong?Slightly OT: This has concerned me since PLabs announced that they wereintegrating bsddb into Python 2.3 - it's going to make it very easy(especially on Windows) for someone to write code that uses anydbm, wrap itup with Py2exe and ship it under a commercial license, not knowing thatthey're breaking the Sleepycat license.  They've never heard of SleepycatSoftware or even bsddb - as far as they're concerned, this "bsddb.pyd" filethat Py2exe tells them they need to ship is just another part of Python,like _socket.pyd or select.pyd.-- Richie Hindlerichie@entrian.com_______________________________________________Spambayes mailing listSpambayes@python.orghttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/spambayes

There are abazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state ofCalifornia messed up and the energy producers exploited.I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles likethe blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the peoplewho crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts andexploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the stateof California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn'tnecessarily the answer.You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their jobs.The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrotethe rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no goodrules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway.- Lucas

I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy ofSpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it'ssimple:1.

Hardware acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down atransaction by as much as 1,000-fold. Per this article, XML formatting onlyincreases doc size by about 20-fold.. I'm not sure there are enough "powersof ten" in there to justify hardware acceleration.

But here's the rawbits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... Best, Rohit===========================================================DataPower delivers XML acceleration deviceBy Scott Tyler ShaferAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PTDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in afamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. TheDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses."Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. "The XA35 is the first of a family."Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size upto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML."Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly said. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. Firewalls are blind to XML today."Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the companyitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware."Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes will be mostly false.Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytesand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection ofXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an applicationco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch inMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration.The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises.=========================================================================DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions ofproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.=========================================================================DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in FundingVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneerin XML-Aware Networking for Web ServicesCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of Directors.DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing andsales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactionsat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology."Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of XML that is required to support next generation enterprise applications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower Technology."DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Webservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A singleDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports."In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said Michael Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. "By turbo-charging their networks with DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls.""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidlygrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and security," said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. "DataPower is ontheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web services," said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. "DataPowers XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that relyon XML for mission critical applications."About Venrock AssociatesVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the Rockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs that now spans over seven decades.

So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed byone of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities ofwater spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, thetoilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilethad cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder whatare the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelainbowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it witha sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recentpast -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone Iknow. The guts, yeah, they fail all the time. But the storage bowl -- never.Geesh.- Jimhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

I have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now.   (It isamazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough forUPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop andits battery supply...)First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem wasoccurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand asequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list ofsuch things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.This one solves the initial problem:--- mh.tcl.WAS	Thu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002+++ mh.tcl	Wed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002@@ -487,6 +487,10 @@     set seq {}     set rseq {}     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {+	if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {+	    # just ignore anything bogus+	    continue;+	} 	set parts [split [string trim $range] -] 	if {[llength $parts] == 1} { 	    lappend seq $partsThat is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurringbefore (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we shouldprobably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just "continue"if you like, but I don't think an error is needed).But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,by typing "NNN-" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather thanhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean itwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing todo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stucka "catch" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that theuser has typed.This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybeallowing a sequence name, like "prev" or "next", or anything else canbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they haveto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.If you type "66+" the "66" changes to "67" (and so on, for each + thatis typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of "+ is bound to adifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing thecurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the currentinput mode is a message number, so let it mean...", but now I found it,I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  Thatkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the specialuse of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those fromthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two differentrestrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a namebeginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible totoggle between typing the current & target folder name when the namebeing typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think Ican live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them toexist and be typed.Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about anotherfeature that has always bugged me.   In "normal" keyboard mode, 's' isthe key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, andthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to nowshow that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead.So I "fixed" this one as well.   "Fixed" here is in quotes, as it assumesthat the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to somethingelse, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have itdiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in orderto bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course.And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made itclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the nextmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard hadreverted to its usual bindings.In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believethat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the"catch" around the "MsgShow" will hide the problem (I don't think we reallyneed to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, justfor completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but notthe previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).kre--- select.tcl.WAS	Thu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002+++ select.tcl	Wed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]     bind $w <Any-Key>	{SelectTypein %W %A}     bind $w <Key-plus>	{SelectToggle %W }+    bind $w <Key-minus>	{SelectPrev %W }     bind $w <space>	{SelectComplete %W}     bind $w <Tab>	{SelectComplete %W}     bind $w <Return>	{SelectReturn %W}+    bind $w <Key-s>	{SelectReturn %W %A}     bind $w <BackSpace>	{SelectBackSpace %W}     bind $w <Control-h>	{SelectBackSpace %W}     bind $w <Delete>	{SelectBackSpace %W}@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@     append select(sel) $a     Exmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"     if ![info exists select(folder)] {-	Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow+	catch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }     } } proc SelectBackSpace { w } {@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@ proc SelectToggle {w} {     global select     if [info exists select(folder)] {+	if {$select(sel) != ""} {+	    SelectTypein $w ++	    return+	} 	set select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]] 	set select(prompt) "[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:"     } else {@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@     }     Exmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)" }+proc SelectPrev {w} {+    global select+    if [info exists select(folder)] {+	SelectTypein $w "-"+    } else {+	catch {+	    incr select(sel) -1+	    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow+	}+        Exmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"+    }+} proc SelectComplete { w } {     global select     if [info exists select(folder)] {@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@ 	Exmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"     } }-proc SelectReturn { w } {+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {     global select     if [info exists select(folder)] {+	if {$a != {}} {+	    SelectTypein $w $a+	    return+	} 	if [info exists select(match)] { 	    set select(sel) $select(match) 	    unset select(match)@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@ 	unset select(folder)     }     $select(entry) configure -state disabled+    Exmh_Status ""     Exmh_Focus } proc SelectClear { w } {_______________________________________________Exmh-workers mailing listExmh-workers@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers

They have an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of "renting" the system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong about the safety of a smart card.  What do you think ?-- Yannick GingrasCoder for OBB : Oceangoing Bared Bonanzahttp://OpenBeatBox.org

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85505995Date: Not suppliedI've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he blogged the hell out of the talk:     Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano     roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!),     "the Betamax affair"... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax     case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would     not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the     VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the     case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a     technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses.     This principle is under attack.     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright     measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits     distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content     scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another,     override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial     for creating a piece of code.

Can you say"Bootstraps", boys and girls? I knew you could...[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taughtyou in a government-run "high" school, you'll probably get more of*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever getaround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsingtransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer'sgovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind ofinnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west thissummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers outthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a"terminal" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from thebest school possible.Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over theyears for proof.Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League afterWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* whogoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actuallyafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, whocouldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in thelast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,and "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal"degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, orlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and lossbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life afterdeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb peoplewho don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of thisrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it tobeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. Youwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went toMissouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,much less a "terminal" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone onthis list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots witheducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. Thefacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, andeconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, includingignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,intelligence and effort.[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level ofcompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,apparently.]BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, andthere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practicallyall of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency andnot "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.That efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in ThePeople's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and betterstuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois conceptapparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'dknow about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increasein general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking aboutextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone whodoesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of somepolitician as Santa Claus come election time...In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is nottheft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, andredistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is justthat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marxwrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.Cheers,RAH-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPY511cPxH8jf3ohaEQLAsgCfZhsQMSvUy6GqJ5wgL52DwZKpIhMAnRuRYYboc+IcylP5TlKL58jpwEfu=z877-----END PGP SIGNATURE------- -----------------R.

Here's a weird and wacky problem:I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?Cheers,Waider.-- waider@waider.ie / Yes, it /is/ very personal of me-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

Few days before my husband was assassinated, he instructed meand my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)forcesintervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My childrenand Imanaged to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We cameintoTogo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVEMILLIONUNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have depositedwith aTrust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with thecurriercompany who will freight the money to your country.Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment inyourcountry because of a stable political situation there and mostly for thefuture ofmy children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from theTrustCompany in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will bedepositedinto your account for investment in your country.

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to have a separate call for "what sequences are in this folder?" and "what messages are in this sequence?".  One option would have been to add another call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time technique would be less error-prone.I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences for all messages.

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top The New York TimesSeptember 23, 2002High-Altitude RambosBy BOB HERBERTDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from LakeWorth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month inone of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in theU.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight fromAtlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach sectionbegan behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to dowith Dr. Rajcoomar.Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved backto coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slightman who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuerrefused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were tryingout for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained himin a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quitejittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flightattendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals werenot ready to let things quiet down.One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. Themarshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, andremain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for anyreason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should tryto visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone whodisobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there wereterrorists on the plane."I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurizedcabin," said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court ofCommon Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in anaisle seat in coach. "I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfirein a shootout."Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from herhusband, said, "It was really like Rambo in the air." She worried thatthere might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and thereforedid not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to thebathroom, he or she might be shot.There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. Whenthe plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken intocustody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshalsgrabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason thatanyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station wherehe was thrown into a filthy cell.This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken intocustody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frighteninghours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they wereeventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss theincident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "tooclosely."If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reportersare headed for jail.Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. "Ihad never been treated like that in my life," he said. "I was afraid that Iwas about to be beaten up or killed."Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case andhe has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawfuldetention."We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security," saidDr. Rajcoomar. "So many men and women have fought and died for freedom inthis great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name ofsecurity."-- -----------------R. A.

You have the choice to ignore itThat's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot say what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is "fit to print." If the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it chose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them news.The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the "publisher" (if any) decides or the "community" (if any) negotiates or does as a matter of custom.For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an expression of their political beliefs.Tom

Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System Vor so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to ahundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available inSolaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way todo essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has foryears; and FreeBSD has kqueue.More details about these are athttp://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlapdisk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, justuse multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that mostproprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currentlyrewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch towork asynchronously, because they can easily build efficientsynchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the otherway around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg sayingthings like "Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has anyidea at all how the hardware functions," but he's totally off-base.People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, butapparently some don't, so I'll rebut.Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than theoriginal stupid errors.In detail, he wrote:> Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally> catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for> nontrivial apps? No way!Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 yearsago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussingfor many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from themat all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while withmultiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extraperformance.> OK, so they do it with signals or a flag, which is completely> ghetto, but at least they are trying. Keep trying guys, you got the> idea, but not the clue.Readers can judge who lacks the clue here.> The Windows I/O model does definately [sic] blow the doors off the> UNIX one, but then they had select to point at in it's [sic]> suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX is just> now looking at it's [sic] I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess> multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API> comes out of it.Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIscome from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.They might be even older than that.Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementationshave supported multithreading for a decade or more.> Bottom line is the "do stuff when something happens" model turned> out to be right, and the UNIX "look for something to do and keep> looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look"> is not really working so great anymore.Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion witha "signal", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a "signal" causesthe immediate execution of a "signal handler" in a process.  Bycontrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (suchas completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the processpolls them.I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got thetechnical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronousnetwork I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signalqueue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().-- <kragen@pobox.com>       Kragen Sitaker     <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/>Edsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

i'm a very happy user of exmh, but i'm paranoid also :-)therefore i'm not too happy with exmh caching my pgp passphrases.usually i use a relatively secure tool called 'quintuple agent' <URL:http://www.vibe.at/tools/secret-agent/> to store my passphrases,and i've just added the few lines of code to exmh which allow for suchexternal caches.the patch is attached, it is against version 2.5-1 (debian), and thefiles modified are extrasInit.tcl and pgpExec.tcl.i've added three new preferences in the 'general pgp' section, whichallow everybody to use his/her favourite external tool to get thepassphrase (everything which spits out the phrase on stdout is ok).i'd be happy if somebody with cvs access thinks that this stuff is worth to be added and does so; apart from that i'm happy for suggestions, comments or critique (mind you, i'm not exactly a special friend of tcl so my code may leave things to be desired...)regardsaz

Seems like every CD player should include thecapability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs inserted. Playback would then never need to face seek delays... after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-first-track operation.You could also take the CD out while it is "playing".Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don'teven have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-throughUI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye ofsome sort... and the player recognizes it from the silkscreening. Kids would like that. "Play this," they'dsay, facing the CD at the player, and the player wouldstart immediately.- Gordon

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/09/26/bonoact.DTLOpening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyrightlaw, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work ofothers.....To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internetbookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that willbring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide freehigh-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that arealready in the public domain.--------I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, andsaw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put asmall satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and bindingmachine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out acopy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Totalfixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IAhad the equipment donated) is under $10k.One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, ifthey wished, add these "virtual holdings" (public domain materials) to theirexisting library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should becompelling to small libraries in remote areas.- Jim
This is preaty neat.- Adam L. "Duncan" Beberg  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/  beberg@mithral.comPitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind DatesThu Sep 5,10:09 AM ETBERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what theyare eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because thebar is pitch black.The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate onsenses other than sight.Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter RolandZimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has beenblind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutleryand drinks."I'm putting your plate right in front of you," Zimmermann said. "I can'tfind my mouth," one voice replied out of the dark. "I wonder what this dishis -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?" another invisible guest said.In the "unsicht-Bar," which means invisible in German, diners cannot choosecomplete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would likea fish, meat or vegetarian option."We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling andsmelling," said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind andsight-restricted people, which is running the bar."People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking overand are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent," headded.Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around tohelp, Scharnbach said.And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers haveactually been eating.

I guess the first question here should be does anyone have someupdates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I firstget a button that reads:	"Check the signature with GnuPG"If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyringthen I get a message saying just that, and the message:	"Can't check signature: public key not found"along with a button with the inscription	"Query keyserver"If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myselfand then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that itmust be the code that goes out to the keyserver.Anyone else with this problem?This is EXMH v2.5 and tcl/tk 8.4a4--                                         Reg.Clemens                                        reg@dwf.com_______________________________________________Exmh-users mailing listExmh-users@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users
FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236email : mikebundu@rediffmail.comDear Sir/MadamSEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. Thisis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strangeand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of theDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic ofCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels inmy country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms andammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebelgroup. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of otherCabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before wewere schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company herein Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest andseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other MilitaryPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late PresidentLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner whocan assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under DiplomaticCover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems fromour lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who workedwith the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that withyour sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within twoweeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of thisfund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful inorder not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund outof Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personalinformation to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone'sSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal assoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise theutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.Thank you and God Bless. Best Regards COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.comN\B.

I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my kernel by hand.  I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.The diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using "uname -p", while %{krpm} is left undefined.The second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.  (If the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have retained the sources in the expected place.)Again, I realize that I'm operating "off warrantee" by not using a Red Hat kernel RPM.  Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up.  If not, well at least this message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85482094Date: Not suppliedJanis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented science fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot groupmind about her views on the music industry.     Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore -     not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux     Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy     saying "So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is     that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model.     Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a     more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the     detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to     root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an     RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic     shakeout in Webcasting is "inevitable and desirable because it will bring     about market consolidation." That's really it in a nutshell. "Market     consolidation" means the less artists they have to promote, the less     ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the     chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because     that's all you'll be able to find out there.

Fair enough.> What I'd recommend in your case [...]Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-)What I've done instead is to create a tiny little "kernel.spec" thatinstalls no files but claims to produce a kernel package having versionnumber `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims toprovide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to makealsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representationof what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should havethought of this approach sooner._______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

I'm not sure why it is important that thefirst message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily anyof the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in thesequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the currentfolder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to thedirectory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into "near-line" archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be recovered on demand.These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between traditional ATA and SCSI drives.For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server environments."The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, financial documents and transaction records," said Mike Dooley, senior director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. "Users may not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these enterprise applications."The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a three-year warranty.The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive environments and enterprise applications.With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with increased design flexibility and hot plug capability."Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that has previously been too expensive to keep on disk," said Dave Reinsel, analyst at IDC. "The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications."AvailabilityLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.About MaxtorMaxtor Corporation (www.maxtor.com) is one of the world's leading suppliers of information storage solutions.

FROM:MR. DESMOND STEVENS                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHERS MONEY TO  A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. AS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY.

http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802BThe Disappearing AllianceBy Dale Franks 10/08/2002For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been ourclosest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of theCold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Wecelebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberationof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology thatHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed "progressivetransnationalism". The key doctrines of this form of post-communistprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are thedeconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas ofcitizenship (i.e. a "global" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, andthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as theUnited Nations.The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through thepooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While thereis a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelectedEuropean Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limitsto their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, whereelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has anappointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes ofthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desiredby the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justiceregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU membergovernments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list ofcomplaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the factthat our republican system of government is not based on proportionalrepresentation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despisethe fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economyis so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywherein the world.On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independentnewspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should berestrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decadeor so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because itexaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather becausethe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion ofthe US literally fantastic.At least, for now.Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the factremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the Europeanintellectual and political elite.The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps incheck the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such asystem in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannotunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of nationalsovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than itdoes on compliance with international "norms." They view all departuresfrom such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equalvote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since theprocess is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The troublewith this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democraticsocieties. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusalsto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve theliberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because itsdictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated referencesto the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions tocomply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on acommitment toconstitutional rights.None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, orcooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism infavor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, whiletheir tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such apolitical atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitablyincrease.That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is thethought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of thenew ideology of transnational progressivism.-- -----------------R. A.

The Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected  By Bruce Johnston in Rome (Filed: 28/08/2002)    Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.   Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena  Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine, contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.  Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.  Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.  As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.  Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back, was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.  Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers from video footage.  Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.  The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours. But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.  The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not grab their reins.  The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods' boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.  The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin.------------------------ Yahoo!

Forwarded-by: Per Hammer <perh@inrs.co.uk>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2218715.stmBrothel duty for Australian MPA conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to spend the day as a "slave" at one of Western Australia's most notorious brothels. Liberal Party member Barry Haase was "won" in a charity auction after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. [...]"I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his political career to make informed decisions that he might not have been able to make before," Ms Kenworthy said. Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. "You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game," he said. 
As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, butI'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.If a user has a line like:whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.comin his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in fromyahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And ifthe latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mailto be ignored?  I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be onyahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the aboveline has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail isstill going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you wouldexpect to trigger SA.Thanks in advance for any help.--Ken Scott,admin@shellworld.net-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same oldcell phone?

Hi All,Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56KFaxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have toconnect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote serveras it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windowsworked first time(!?), any ideas?Baud 1200 7 data bits Even ParityI am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1... which is most of the defaults.USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) & set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just givingup.btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring theirmodems may be difficult.Colin.-- Colin Nevin,Software Engineer,Merit Solutions Ltd.

The Times   September 06, 2002  Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties By Roger Boyes    MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to those of the Führer.   Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter, signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald.   The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for membership.   The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany. History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.   The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive, the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923.   Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in Cologne, said.   Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor.   I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic.   For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said.   I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler.   ------------------------ Yahoo!

                         ForewordAfter thirty?three years of being a black man living in "Ghetto America," an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the "Black Generation X". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of "Generation X". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed "Baby Boomers", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled "Generation X", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows:   "We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called "Xer's" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong." This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these "similarities" speak primarily to only "white" issues and concerns. For instance, "they" say "we" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America "we" could only depend on one our mothers! "They" also say, " . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations," and " . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever." In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all "we" have time for. I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the "Black" from "Generation X" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. "White America" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled "Ethnic Notions." When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching "Roger & Me," another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical. Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with "Huxtable?like" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or "working class" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the "Huxtable?like" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our "dirty laundry". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that "black male and female generation X" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our "male rapper" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. "The Big Tymers", a popular rap duo, have a song called "I'm Still Fly", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. ("Fly" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:"I got gator boots with a pimped out GucciSuit, can't pay my rent cause all my money'sspent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly."Worse yet, in the song "Grinding", the popular duo "Eclipse" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term "grinding" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are "grindingyou know what I keep in the lining" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and"Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers manI bake them cakes as fast as I canand you can tell cause of how my bread stack upand I disguise it as rap so the feds backup"In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term "cake" or sometimes "pie") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al luded too. I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of "us" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being "African?Americans", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as "Black", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as "Niggas," a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with "Nigger". The term "nigga" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term "My Nigga") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as "Ghetto", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by "White America". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design. There are other "core" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not "thugged out". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the "thug," and "drug dealer" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that "confused mentality" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American "ghetto" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that "ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into "Black America".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that "backward thinking" is the main  cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.************************************************************* To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.comTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.orgwith "unsubscribe freebsd-ports" in the body of the message

What it boils down to is thatonly the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectivelystill exists (literally the same families), but they now hold topexecutive and management positions in the major French firms and thegovernment, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Notofficially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the lawsand legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep themfrom branching out into a new venture in their own country (though manycan leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know aboutthe French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid aboutit (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspectthis may hold true for other European countries as well.  After all those "revolutions", France is still nothing more than athinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

    Guido> Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The    Guido> Perl Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporateinto a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  Forperformance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a smallC program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes theresult back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fastenough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing thepickle to an anydbm file).Basic procmail usage goes something like this:    :0fw    | spamassassin -P    :0    * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes    $SPAMWhich just says, "Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into theprocessing stream.  If the resulting mail has a header which begins"X-Spam-Status: Yes", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable$SPAM.SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detailabout how its tests fared.  I'd like to see spambayes operate in at leastthis way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified setof headers which further processing downstream can key on.Skip

URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85395270Date: Not suppliedI feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me (or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing wrong, and they don't listen. Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, stupid, incompetent buffoons?"I told you so." never felt so good.Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about fucking time.

Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try todeliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try deliveringto 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting "User unknown" until Igot around to making them spamtraps.So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)If your "business" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you cansay "10 million email addresses" and not technically be lying, even ifthe majority of them don't work.If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, butthen again you don't really care: you probably want to relay throughsomeone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to everyemail address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce addressbecause again it's easy to trace you.So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually thinkyou're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way ofopting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don'trelay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.Everyone else doesn't really care.That's my view anyway. :)--=20Randomly Generated Tagline:"Now you can do that thing with your hands...

Man killed 'trying to surf' on Tube train Ananova Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AMAn investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who triedto "surf" on a Tube train.The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farmstation on the Northern Line on Monday night.Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as itleft the north London station.There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in thetrain.The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at theend of the platform."We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It'snot quite clear what happened," said a London Underground spokeswoman.The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,who today described the death as "non-suspicious."

He expects to break his record next year topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 12 second run.John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph run.

"Duncan" Beberg  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/  beberg@mithral.com--------EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause CancerWed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ETBy H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press WriterWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and othersources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental ProtectionAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government'spush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning enginesand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects ofexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving bothanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancerrisk to humans."It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmentalexposure levels" as well, the report said. "The potential human healtheffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions anduncertainties are involved."The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from variousworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularlysignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates dieselemissions under the Clean Air Act.Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bushadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation thatwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and aseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead withthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postponethe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail tomeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuelis expected to produce pollution reductions.The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate theprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure todiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA whengauging pollution health concerns.But in this case, the report said, "the exposure-response data areconsidered too uncertain" to produce a confident quantitative estimate ofcancer risk to an individual.Nevertheless, said the report, the "totality of evidence from human, animaland other supporting studies" suggests that diesel exhaust "is likely to becarcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies toenvironmental exposure."The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts posesshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a"chronic respiratory hazard to humans" contributing to increased asthma andother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account foras much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needsto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-roaddiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agencyexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaustsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a privateenvironmental organization, said: "To reduce the public's exposure toharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implementclean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalentstandards for diesel construction and farm equipment."Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel TechnologyForum, said the EPA's report "focused on the past," whereas "the future isclean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight timescleaner than just a dozen years ago."The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels inthe mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slowturnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.

Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that its considerablyclearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the common practice ofputting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV cameras, visiting dignitaries,etc, further exacerbating those feelings."Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies" is now usually done by police with riot gear and pepper spray.We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably strayed from the permit area,which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance ministers held here (the motorcade droveby it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and arrested. Not very muddied at all.Owen

Can we consider them as> trusted hardware ?SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again what we've seen is that it's not a question of "is it secure", it's a question of "who is it secure from and for how long?" Security is rarely a question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the $1-20 range (depending on the application).As whether or not they are "trusted hardware", the question again revolves around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is likely "trustworthy" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.-- Alex Russellalex@SecurePipe.comalex@netWindows.org

URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85409355Date: Not suppliedBlake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, "Do you really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!"Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.To cover the list specifically:- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain speed.- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's top usability problem.- Message display - Yes. No argument here.- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's a mess.- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., you can eliminate the New submenu easily).- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. (We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 wants to fire it.)- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is completely irrelevant.- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously overconfigurable.[1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641[2] http://mpt.phrasewise.com

Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and theMadness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrasesbriefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,"like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog inCheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London."Was "like a frog in Cheapside" (or something similar) a catch phraseitself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?And to what event or events does it refer?I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of CatchPhrases.*bc------------------------ Yahoo!

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.Ethrough licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking torobots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when theydiscover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to amachine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendlyand therefore empty 'thx'.AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a firstline of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won'tuse it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and moreclever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't juststumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but allit takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it'sill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's andother later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, evensimpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they'retalking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated andterse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive aclunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computeruser still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slowclunky interface.Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattleweather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weathericon sitting there on your desktop?Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:http://www.botspot.com/best/12-09-97.htm-- Gary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -  "Computers are useless.

I've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forumsfor several years.  I've always found archaeology interesting for noparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that Iactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com--------------------------------------------http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bountyof a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, EdKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000feet. "It looked like a bison skull," the building contractor andamateur archaeologist recalls. "I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don'tlive this high up.' "Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from abisonone that died about 340 years ago. "This was an extraordinarydiscovery," says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that itcould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "There'sprobably a lot more like it yet to be found."And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers andsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peruto Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars andindustryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. Asthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts isemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deepfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the muckyfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of ourpredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued."It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced throughstudying these remains," says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitudearchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National GeographicSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discoveredin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "IceMan," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, haveoffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, asthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasionaltreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before MotherNatureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains candeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they'reoften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon themdon't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier inBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was adead animal. "It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. "But when I lookedcloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a furtrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Locbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumedthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and whatseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunterlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long AgoPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (whomay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved humanfrom the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region couldexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in thefirst place. "Before this there was no archaeological record of peopleliving here," says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. "Now wesee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedekcaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the southYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered incaribou dung. "It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't beencaribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls Kuzyk, then awildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found "what looked like apencil with string wrapped around it." It turned out to be a4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of theice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layercakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to theice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discardedsome equipment in the ice. "We've got people hunting with throwing dartsup until 1,200 years ago," says Hare, who now oversees the researchproject. "Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwingdarts."Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. Theyare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on whereglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known tohave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangelland St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciatedterrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawingEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite asthe Ice Man. "Global warming is providing us high-altitudearchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We'reprobably about the only ones happy about it."

Each download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy in a near futur.

Thus, my bookPrinciples of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teachingmethods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.Perhaps youhave also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dunebuggy, etc.). These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, buttheycannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions mustbebased on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarkson abook about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are manydifferences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transferratherdirectly. According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call``thethree E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,whichBillington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each inturn. Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources UsedIn structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safetyand theissues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming languagedesign,efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples whereefficiencyconsiderations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of ProgrammingLanguages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processingtime, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized wasprogrammer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN'simplicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificedfor thesake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that wearenot comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same asprogrammer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both arereduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we nowturn. Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus CostWhereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seekstomaximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridgesareusually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''thatmust be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which theseprogrammers work. Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the costofcomputer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved theincreasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost ofprogrammaintenance compared to program development. Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether majormanufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in somewayby influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whetheritcomes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used bynovicesor dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors arefrequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programminglanguage. Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits areoftenunstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, fromdissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccuratelyrepresented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be consideredinseeking an economical design. Elegance Symbolizes Good Design``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly thecriticalrole of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. For the DesignerIt is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of thedifficultyof analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).Structuralengineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don'tmakeextensive use of computer models and calculation. One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about whichvariables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if thisdecision is notmade well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and thisisanother potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematicalanalysismay overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price ofsafety isadditional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make achoice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and anover-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; itvibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was aconsequence ofan increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyedtheTacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guidedby aesthetic principles. According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they donotabandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is becausesolutions tostructural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possiblesolutions to aparticular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attentiontodesigns in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces areunbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process canbeguided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this ideabyinverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds(p.21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice ofform is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient andeconomical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which theinteractionof features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let ouraesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without havingtocheck all the possible interactions. For the UserIn this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridgethatlooks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in whichfeatures may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designedbridgegives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language shouldreinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in theconsequencesof our actions. We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable tosustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on theoutside.So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestationof adeep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their(unwarranted)confidence. In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As aconsequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges orprogramming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limitedvalue unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize thepreceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages:                                 The Elegance Principle              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. The Programming Language as Work EnvironmentThere are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programminglanguage is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortableandsafe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities thattakeplace within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer'sfatigueand frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as anatural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouragingthe programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programminglanguage should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety ofits features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features mayrepresent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programminglanguage can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; byneglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.Out ofsight, out of mind. Acquiring a Sense of EleganceAesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refinedsenseof elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensiveexperiencein design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from eachcompetition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The publicalsocritiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops alongwith that of the designers. So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designsand tryto improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''comesalong.

So I'm not > about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.One more salvo on X and cut/paste.  X specifies at least two *mechanisms*for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  Windows and Macintoshhave a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I'm quitesure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selectionon your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicitCopy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which isanother archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)by versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all thesemechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code inText_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come upwith 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet anothersetting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.

They mention 300 to 500 partners a year. (Anecdotally. This is not a statistic). They also mention that this was specific to gay males. Lesbians don't dig promiscuity in that degree.

http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.htmlHamza's horrid - but we must tolerate himRod LiddleWednesday August 28, 2002The GuardianSheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeymanto scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playingwith his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do onstatutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on theway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in thesea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchenfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America andmaybe me and you, too.But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since theBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he soundedhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamicproto-warriors in the background.You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the DailyMail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eyecovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don'tmock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whomwe don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves comeoff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of theBritish right) as "Captain Hook", in articles which usually call for hisarrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybeoff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years andthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And ifwe can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force himto shut up.Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him beforeSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we allthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into politicalpersecution.And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they'vegot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatorymanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out ofcontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. Butperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness andtolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror'sscoop.Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlierthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of hisallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners weremeant to do stuff like that.He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have beenfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to themedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporationsand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to betrue - Hamza is not "representative" of British Muslims, as if BritishMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one couldturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he wasrevealed to be rather more "representative" than the list of thosegovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorismand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that anoverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thoughtthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at thetime, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy athome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone fromthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of USforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger actionagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don'tsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was gratefulfor the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who hasbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather moreinflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. Hisideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would behappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, forexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterlyrepellent.And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desireto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerfulappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by theruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views thatare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothingremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecutionis simply the pungency of his views.It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because hisrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. Thisis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. Andif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense ofunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it isnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the manup, therefore, won't make a difference.It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.------------------------ Yahoo!

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factorof at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-messagebasis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle> spam.

There's nobodyleft to charge except the people who want (or are forced against theirwill because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas tomake all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purposefor which it was designed.Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits againstreal spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rightsto use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've bothcreated and monopolized a market for "internet postage stamps" thateverybody has to pay them for.The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they doabsolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people withlawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectlyfrom everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for theprivilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'llever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.[*] And I use the term "they" loosely, because the whole company could consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Spamassassin-talk mailing listSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

The technique works for input values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

So the CPAN shell  > can't automatically upgrade this module. I cannot think of any way  > around this.  I could think of a solution: We could remove the "use" line and add the version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines   require ExtUtils::MakeMaker;   ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl Makefile.PL` will die with a "Uncaught exception from user code: ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at Makefile.PL line 103." there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if CPAN will run the make anyway...  > To add insult to injury, the PM_FILTER part gets run during pm_to_blib,  > which would be fine, except ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn't let you write a  > MY::pm_to_blib - it's non-overridable!

That's not a very clean approach but could work.  We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We already have a useless line "pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made" there. Adding some commands in this section gives some make warnings ("Makefile:933: warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'") but does work. Not a very good solution either.  > So I'm *strongly* against the current use of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45  > usage (if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote), and  > really hope we can find another way.  The "use MakeMaker::..." error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA installation. But that's just my opinion ;-)  I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know. ------- You are receiving this mail because: -------You are on the CC list for the bug, or are watching someone who is.-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Spamassassin-devel mailing listSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)Dear Sir, I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of us. The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was lodged into a security company here in the Country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled aspersonal belongings and as such the security company does not know the true content of the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign. Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund. If you are interested to carry out this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us.You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy communication Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 (seven) working days.I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} ______________________________________________________Bo=EEte aux lettres - Caramail - http://www.caramail.com
Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get on TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to get information.but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be aswell protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool fordissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipientscan't be blamed for being on a mailing list.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Dear friend,I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situationtill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United StateDollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claimof the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties andstock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level ofconfidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust andconfidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you wherethe funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.Yours sincerely,Mrs. Mariam M.

The Times August 28, 2002  It's August, and big cats are on the prowl By Alan Hamilton    ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big, vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday, including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike.   Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings.   During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them.   Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.   Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black hairy tufts on the tips of its ears.   The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the beasts, which it will then present to the Government.   It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all. Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start.   Next in August: record abductions by aliens.  ------------------------ Yahoo!

Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal withspammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially inother countries, where those judgments are harder to get.Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go afterregular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatantpyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but thevast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, Ican't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammersdown when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records ofthe business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records ofthe ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used forthe whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're notsecret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' wholebusiness is about finding them and putting them out of businessHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole businessplan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with "not spam", I can'tunderstand why you would assume ahead of time that we will beunsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove thepotential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on theHabeas warrant mark.Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself onyour installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to onlylicense the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators onthe HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly removeus from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before ithas a chance to show any promise.At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that itencourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (thosewithout SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (thetransmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don'tsteal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.          - dan--Dan Kohn <mailto:dan@dankohn.com><http://www.dankohn.com/>  <tel:+1-650-327-2600> -----Original Message-----From: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38To: Matthew ClineCc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.netSubject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

Between now and conclusion of the first court   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,   "pump and dump" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly   required for the spammer to get their way.Dan-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications platform!

The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger clientthat combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in thehyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes anuntrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the usersmachine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before theuser clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren'tvulnerable.The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browsercommand to the shell.

For example, perhaps they were broken into sets byarrival time.  If that's what you did, you should go back and break theminto sets randomly instead.  If you did partition them randomly, the wildvariance across runs is mondo mysterious.>> I expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand>> grepping.

It is first recorded as being used by Captain > Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: "I won't thrash you Tom. > Shiver my timbers if I do".It seems implausible to me that "shiver" here means "to shake"; I don'trecall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913lists that sense as "v. i.", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of"shiver", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means"to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow".Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,leaves you with a sinking boat.)So, "Shiver my timbers if I do," can be reasonably interpreted as a morevivid way of saying, "May I die suddenly if I do."  The interpretationsuggested by Quinion, "May my boat be damaged," neither makes as muchsense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.I've sent a copy of this to Quinion.

QED.My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code bymore than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation ofadditional features that drove us to do the conversion in the firstplace.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in Cthan in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endlesscollection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond thecore libraries of any language that much though.On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many thingsdue primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a givennon-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function ina pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, butlibraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me evenif they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn'tparticularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a librarythat really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've builta small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the yearsthat I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse whenyou get right down to it.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481620Close encounter of burnt kindIT came from outer space ­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convincedthe object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her homein Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studiedacademic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirlis adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation ­ that theodd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed ­ becauseit was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury."I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubblesurface," she said.After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures onthe Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to checkthe object for authenticity.If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up forauction.She added: "If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myselffor sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite."But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme ofacademic caution."Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a pieceof extraterrestrial rock," he said."They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressionsand cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burntaround the edge."Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is thesmallest that they usually appear."To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would haveto be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of itbeing extra-terrestrial are slim."Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the sizeof the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite."However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,"he added. ------------------------ Yahoo!

On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 05:13:01PM +0100, Fergal Moran mentioned:> In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX. Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail. Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can makesolaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship withsolaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar toother unixen like HPUX and SCO. Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. Oneof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting yourhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a softwareproblem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. Thereis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from acheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.John-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

Of course, hitting 'return' doesntwork so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that thepassphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time withproper focus set.I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possiblysome borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg./Valdis

Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in his setup (like -F going away). So if we say "the branches are stable to the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out when you update to a new minor version number", users and sysadmins could be less reluctant to update.All just IMHO :o)MalteP.S.: I'll be away from my box and my mail account for one week, starting tomorrow.

Itshould have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scoreswere included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purelysymmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have beenbalancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negativewould be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today'schoice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assumethings work differently than they do.Bob
The Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far (Filed: 28/08/2002)    So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield.  Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.  Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia.  After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side.  "The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet," said Kommersant.  "In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."  The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.  It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops.  And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that "the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life.  "The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks."  There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling.  The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics.  While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty.  "For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."  One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border.  However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live.  France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country "where English is only known by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists".  Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.  Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common. And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.  Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the climatic problems, it said that "thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself".  Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.  "Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens."  Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home.------------------------ Yahoo!

URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.htmlDate: Not suppliedFeedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. *"Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end."* There are a couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant. Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup Screenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left their system in an indeterminate state. In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where I can display a useful error message. And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So part one of the batch is "Stop IIS." Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I don't need to write the code for "Start IIS" for the end of the batch. So the code to rollback "Stop IIS" is already written. No big deal, I just need to call it at the right place. I think one reason that people think you should "gather all the info and then do all the work" is because with very large installation programs that are very slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the "create account" operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for IIS to stop and start. *"Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive."* First of all, leave your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring.  Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do in this setup program are things like "grant the Logon as Service privilege to an account." This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library I've been using for years to make wizards. *"Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup programs don't increase sales."* This was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code. - Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. - Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it and say "Aha!"*"How can we make WISE[4] better?" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html[2] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ[3] http://discuss.fogcreek.com/delphiquestions[4] http://www.wise.com

This means we'd also have to getall the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play arequest, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous andnearly impossible...We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't haveserial numbers and barcodes.

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police IreSat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ETWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online "anarchist scavengerhunt" proposed for next week's annual meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) andWorld Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ireof police, who fear demonstrators could damageproperty and wreak havoc.Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture aWashington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporateexecutive or World Bank delegate.D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told acongressional hearing on Friday that law authoritieswere in talks to decide whether planned protests were,"so deleterious to security efforts that we ought totake proactive action."Several thousand people are expected to demonstrateoutside the IMF and World Bank headquarters nextweekend.The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-basedanarchist group, is also planning a day-long trafficblockade, banner-drops and protests against majorcorporations in the downtown core.Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist sitewww.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke."People were asking for things to do when they come toD.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so theydon't do the boring, standard stuff," he said. "Idoubt people will actually keep track of what they dofor points."

It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is"NEVER".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publicationsduring the past decade, and after using day tradingto successfully make more than four million dollars inthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't becomewealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn frommy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,secret formula for day trading that I've used profitablyyear after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.

It occurs at the very endof an excellent article which I recommend to you.In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has beenlistening to an heroic sermon about "the glory to be won in battle by youngpatriots armed with the love of God." He usurps the pulpit and prays thefollowing:"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with ourshells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of theirpatriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks oftheir wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes witha hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widowswith unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their littlechildren to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags andhunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds ofwinter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge ofthe grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast theirhopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy theirsteps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the bloodof their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is theSource of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all thatare sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen."Twain wrote the story, "The War Prayer," in 1905 during the Americanoccupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923,thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it "unsuitable"for publication at the time it was written.#  distributed via <nettime>: no commercial use without permission#  <nettime> is a moderated mailing list for net criticism,#  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets#  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and "info nettime-l" in the msg body#  archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net--- end forwarded text-- -----------------R.

You did put /home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the data as is.If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM!

This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.Sure does explain FoRK :-)not yet abandoned,  Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.eduSome Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than GoodSeptember 10, 2002By MARY DUENWALD  Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,scientific research has suggested that people who havestrong friendships experience less stress, they recovermore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to livelonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptibleto the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give toomuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now callingattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. "Friendship is often very painful," said Dr. HarrietLerner, a psychologist and the author of "The Dance ofConnection." "In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions willrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thingis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say thisis bad for my health and I'm disbanding it." Another book, "When Friendship Hurts," by Dr. Jan Yager, asociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside."There's this myth that friendships should last alifetime," Dr. Yager said. "But sometimes it's better thatthey end." That social scientists would wait until now to spotlightthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, consideringthat they have only recently paid close attention tofriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -between siblings or parents and children - have been seenas more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to leadto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. Andchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships gobad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.Lerner said, "Never once have I had anyone write and say mybest friend hits me." Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at theUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to therole of friends in emotional and physical health. "Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on forstability the way it was in the past, and because peopleare less likely to be living with or near extended familymembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships asa way of building community and finding intimacy," said Dr.Fehr, the author of "Friendship Processes." Until the past couple of years, the research on friendshipfocused on its health benefits. "Now we're starting to lookat it as a more full relationship," said Dr. Suzanna Rose,a professor of psychology at Florida InternationalUniversity in Miami. "Like marriage, friendship also hasnegative characteristics." The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yetmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,figured out that it is a significant problem. The earlyresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by afriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, bydrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advisedpursuit. "When you think of people who were friends atEnron," she added, "you can see how friendship can supportantisocial behavior." Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. "When friendssplit up," said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor ofpsychology at the University of South Carolina, "it isoften in cases where one has shared personal information orsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential."Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friendsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. "It'smore than just pulling away," she said. "The silenttreatment is actually malicious." At least as devastating is an affair with the friend'sromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.Lerner's patients. "I would not encourage her to hang inthere and work this one out," Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insultsthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people whoresponded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendshipdescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her"a derogatory name." The woman, now 32, was so devastatedthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open withpeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,but it is "more insidious," Dr. Yager said. "Some peopleconstantly set up their friends," she explained. "They'llhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he orshe finds out." Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extremekinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not theonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupyingthe second tier of badness are the liar, the person who isoverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the personwho meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor andthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. "This includes everyonefrom the person who says let's have a cup of coffee butsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone whopromises to be there for you when you need them, but thenisn't," Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasonsto dislike the other one. "With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone todiscover there's something important they don't like aboutthe other person," said Dr. Rose of Florida International."One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the otherperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,it may take even more time for one person to meet theother's dislike criteria." Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,"depends on how large the injury is." "Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and letsomething go," she added. "It's also an act of maturitysometimes to accept another person's limitations." Acceptance should come easier among friends than amongspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than onefriend and do not need a full range of emotional supportfrom each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point whereone friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that thefriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response isto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personalor intimate details of life, and start being too busy toget together, ever. "It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,but only one to end it," Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is fareasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is alsocomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of abad friendship should leave a person with more time andappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. "It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and havethem in order while you're healthy and your life and workare going well," she said.

i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.-h>From: "Rob Shavell" <rob@mobiusvc.com>>To: "'Mike Masnick'" <mike@techdirt.com>>Cc: <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>>Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??>Date: Wed, 21 Aug 2002 01:10:50 -0700>>right Mike,>>i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is>only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant>show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am>mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.>>my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways>once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see>amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on>their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just>that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family>life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion>of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of>their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of>photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes>things 'big time'.>>rgds,>rob>>>-----Original Message----->From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com]>Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM>To: Rob Shavell>Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org>Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??>>>Not to keep harping on this, but...>>At 11:36 PM 8/20/02 -0700, Rob Shavell wrote:>>>content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful'>content>>is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users>>communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send>>half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who>>cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.>>This does nothing to answer my question.

Images are overlayed on the topological data to help peoplenavigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as awannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional modelof the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered ina city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of theearth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map allsorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.Got it?-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

Ananova:  Dracula theme park could be switched to BucharestA controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could beswitched away from Transylvania.Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built inBucharest instead.It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against theoriginal proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsiderin the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for theproject.But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, theinspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boostthe local economy.Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital withthe Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: "The pre-feasibility report fromPWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located inBucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it."The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghosttrain and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around areconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisationUnesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project onOctober 15.Story filed: 13:16 Tuesday 8th October 2002------------------------ Yahoo!

Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I > really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that.

In order for thetwo flows to balance, the higherpacket must contain less air thanthe lower, and the mass balanceof the flows corresponds thusly:    high percentage of thin air    ---------------------------    low percentage of dense airNow, rates are exponential inenergy differences[1], so thattheoretically we should expectan exponential decay in height,to compensate.  How does it goin practice?-Dave[0] How well does it balance?    Chemical equilibria seem     stable, as they deal with    very large numbers over a    very long time.  Economic    equilibria are viewed from    the mayfly standpoint of    individual people, and so,    at best, the shot noise is    very visible.[1] That is to say, rates will    be exponential in the free    energy differences between    endpoints and a transition    state.  We can ignore that    complication in this model.

A skip token is produced in lieuof "word" more than 12 chars long and without any high-bit characters.  It'spossible that they helped me because raw HTML produces lots of these.However, if you're running current CVS, Tokenizer/retain_pure_html_tagsdefaults to False now, so HTML decorations should vanish before bodytokenization.

Gordon Mohr quoted:># French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts># By Caroline Brothers>#># PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq># faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred># by calling Islam "the stupidest religion" and its holy book the># Koran a depressing read.>#># The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause># celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of># expression against religious sensitivities.Very reminiscent indeed.  Ayatollah Chirac has decreed a deathsentence on Houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offeredmillions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hidingunder police protection for a few years.Or maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him tocourt under "hate speech" laws make a point about people not showin'dem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.Or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.BTW I read Houellebecq's "Extension du domaine de la lutte" recently,about a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking forlove and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to geta friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic fornutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with someunbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little storiesabout animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quotedinline in full for pages on end.It starts out:"On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues fromwork.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged fromtwenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started gettingundressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, allthe while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a fewseconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn'tknow what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Whichunderlines the absurdity of her behaviour.After my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I hadto go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly afterthat, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not prettyat all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together andread books about the development of language in children, all thatsort of stuff."... and it's downhill from there!R

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85485894Date: Not suppliedBen Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless.     The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet,     8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used?     Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads     were built by English expatriates.     Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were     built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's     the gauge they used.     Why did "they" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways     used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used     that wheel spacing.     So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried     to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old,     long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel     ruts...

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531549Date: Not suppliedPro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of wish-fulfillment -- by "managing" the team, they can be free of the rule of their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the supermarket and asks where he can find the "Burns-O's."     "It's always a trip," Carr says. "The first time I saw myself in a video     game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store     and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."         For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a     television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive     linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the     action-packed "Halo: Combat Evolved."

I am somewhat puzzled by a phone call I (or rather the CIO at the ISP forwhom I work) received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark.The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking ourmail against the razor servers and that since those servers containinformation proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] berequired to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I waswondering if anyone else has received such a call?I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor userswith the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor orwhether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going bythe wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail andthe likes).Sven-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Razor-users mailing listRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users

It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,too.In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing wasactually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man intoslavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive tothe term 'man stealer' in a way I didn't understand.Yep, I know he said all holy books.  No, I don't know if this site wasblowing hot air.

The academic discipline of Software Engineering was launched at a conferencesponsored by NATO, at Garmisch, Germany, in October, 1968. Intriguingly, theterm Software Engineering was chosen to be deliberately provocative -- whycan't software be developed with the same rigor used by other engineeringdisciplines?The proceedings of this conference are now available online, at:http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/old/people/brian.randell/home.formal/NATO/index.htmlAlso, don't miss the pictures of attendees, including many significantcontributors to the field of Software Engineering:http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/old/people/brian.randell/home.formal/NATO/N1968/index.html- Jim

As many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. I'm incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn't (and still can't) think of anything I'd rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I'm sort of embarassed to have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by camping in line with us. So, I'll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you'd like to come with us, let me know. I was hoping I'd be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who couldn't make it, but as I read in today's Times, only lawyers and those with official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an interesting account. In a related irony, today was "Disney Day" at Borders[5], where they played Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of Programming_. In an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, I highly recommend it.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000609[2] http://eldred.cc/[3] http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-10-02.html[4] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/05/opinion/05AMAR.html[5] http://www.bordersstores.com/events/event_detail.jsp?SEID=15127444

...an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered,mercenary-minded lady available on the British singles scene,"Glad to see American culture is making it's way into the British bars too :)God bless us uncivilized bastards, every one.Still, definately something not right about the below. People are nowcheaper then a decent laptop? (ok, so we knew that already)-------------Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in ThailandThu Aug 29,10:19 AM ETBy Andrew MarshallBANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailandlooking for a wife. It took two hours to find her."The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung allmy clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous," he said. "Iknew then there was something special."Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,who is expecting their first child.Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of womenin developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West thatoften turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailandin search of a wife."I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan," he said. "I knew Ifound her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring."Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept intouch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England andthe couple married.MR. MARRIAGELawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agencyMoylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself "Mr. Marriage,"started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introductionagency.Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages."In the last five years we've done about 400," he said. "To the best of myknowledge, they have all been successful."Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries thatrequire them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai womenlooking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch'soffice -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness andlanguage problems."We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"Lynch said. "But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to knoweach other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost everyclient has found a potential wife."At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back andthink he hasn't made his mind up," he said. In most cases, marriage follows,usually within the next year.Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, aBangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and lessthan 10 percent have broken up.Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have justarrived in Bangkok looking for a wife."Sometimes they are very nervous," she said. "And sometimes they are veryimpatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calmdown, OK, we'll talk."'But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wifeand get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wivesfor include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumaticstress disorder.WHY?Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Criticssay they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable toform relationships in their own country, and on the desperation ofimpoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there isno reason to object. "If you talk about people who are needy, I thinkeverybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, Ineed Wan," he said."Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's nosecret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problemwith that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care totheir future husband."Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why theychoose to use his agency.His brochure promises an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized,over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the Britishsingles scene," and says he can make dreams come true even for men who arenot "God's gift to women."Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in theirown countries -- and found Thai women attractive."They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discothequesor restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?Impossible," she said."Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They aregood at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different fromladies from other countries."Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are alsonot a major obstacle."Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about havinga husband who is significantly older," Lynch said. "When I met my wife shecouldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phoneticdictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it upvery quickly."Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they moveto the West."We have kitchens, we have study classes," Roongthip said. "We teach themhow to eat, and when to make tea."PITFALLSBut not all dreams come true. "Bee" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went toSwitzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she isback in Bangkok, sad and angry."He had no friends, and I was so lonely," she said. "I tried to make himhappy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He neverspoke to me."Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. "I thought I would be happythere," she said. "But it was the worst time of my life."Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensureunsuitable candidates are weeded out."We are ethical and professional," he said. "We will not take on allcomers."Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof thearrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,looking for a foreign husband."Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,"Moylan said. "But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal."
This is my Netscape 7.0 Review.o They finally got the email search speed back up to   where it was in 4.7.xo Setting up user mail accounts doesn't have that really   odd, sometimes it lets me sometimes it doesn't problem that   previous versions had.o I still have to manually update all my address books by   hand but at least it lets me import them as Netscape 4.x   address books (there's not 6.x import as they just assume   it works--which it doesn't)o The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that   I've tried to report since 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail   filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number)   Gawd I'd really wish they'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the single   biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it's one of the   most effective anti-spam tools that I have.o Webex doesn't support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin doesn't   work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to   work on something with someone remotely.I've given up trying to report bugs and any changes to thesource I send always get lost.Greg-- Gregory Alan Bolcer, CTO  | work: +1.949.833.2800gbolcer at endeavors.com  | http://endeavors.comEndeavors Technology, Inc.| cell: +1.714.928.5476

GregReuters Market News  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks   Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET   By Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals  making computers which manage networks.   EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working  to make computers "self-healing" when systems break.  "Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box  it is running on," Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference.   Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever  needed.   For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from  different vendors to interoperate closely.   Sun promised to deliver a "virtualization engine" that would let administrators look at  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network.   "It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out," promised MacKay  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said.   Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response  time for priority users, the company said.

http://www.pressherald.com/news/state/021201moose.shtmlMaine Sunday TelegramPortland, MaineSunday, December 1, 2002Driver who hit moose fights county over meatBy GISELLE GOODMAN, Portland Press Herald Writer------------------------------------------------------------------------via http://www.lorencoleman.com------------------------------------------------------------------------ACTON  In her freezer at home, Lisa Pierce has ground beef and roasts,frozen vegetables and french fries, even a couple of Popsicles. What shedoesn't have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car onNov. 5, the moose that was rightfully hers, but instead went to a neighbor.The lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the York County Sheriff'sDepartment to get back what she says she is owed."I think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor," said Pierce. "I'm awoman and he just neglected to think that I would want it. The moose isgone, I know that now. I want to be compensated for the meat."Whether or not that happens is uncertain. Her experience, though, highlightsa law some Mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during thispeak time of deer-versus-car accidents, as the animals, in their matingseason, come out of the woods.The law is simple: A big-game carcass caught by a car - be it a moose, deeror bear - goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcementofficer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident.It comes up quite often in Maine, say officials. Last year, there were 4,055cases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads and 600 accidentsinvolving moose, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine WardenService."In a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, Idon't know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out amoose," said Latti. "You do have the option of keeping it."Which, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car.Farm-grown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. And abutchered or dressed moose, which can't be bought or sold anywhere in Maine,can produce hundreds of pounds of food.Latti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since itsinception in 1991. Every now and then an officer will issue a summons to adriver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. That kind of "hunting"makes no sense to Latti.Hitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. Large adultmoose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. Sincethe bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodiesoften come crashing through windshields in collisions. More often than not,crashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal.Sometimes they are fatal. In 1998, Latti said, there were six moose-relatedfatalities. After that, when the number of moose-hunting permits went from2,000 to 3,000, there were less. Maine had three moose-related fatalities in2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said Stephen McCausland,spokesman for the Maine Public Safety Department.Pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her cardid not become part of that statistic early on Election Day. But she alsofeels cheated by the whole situation. After all, her car was totaled.On the morning of the accident, Pierce was taking her two children and aneighbor's son to school in her 1991 Dodge Dynasty. She said she was goingalong at about 35 mph on a well-traveled road, when a moose came out ofnowhere."By the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield," shesaid. Pierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with thechildren, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose.But the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could dealwith it, so she said she wasn't able to follow up on the animal until laterthat day.When she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave thefully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor.Her neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 ittook him to carry it away, money she didn't think she should spend. By thetime she contacted the Attorney General's Office on Nov. 12 to complainabout the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had gone upanother $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat.And when she called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complainthat she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer'sfault that she didn't have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cashand the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in YorkCounty."At that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, butwanting money," Ouellette said.That conversation, and a similar one she had with York County Sheriff PhilCote, left Pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond themoose.But the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising toother officials."It's the officer's discretion," said Latti. "And if the officer feels theperson can't immediately remove (the animal), he's got to think of publicsafety and other people on the roadway. If someone is worried about herchildren in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to askis if she wants the moose."Maine State Police Trooper Jeremy Forbes said when he arrives at accidentsthat involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal,deer or moose, becomes secondary."The priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital," hesaid. "If they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can'twait, so we'll probably give it to the next person who stops by."This is not comforting to Pierce. She said the deputy could have come to theambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. With herboyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animalherself.She knows her situation is probably a lost cause. But she hopes otherpeople, especially other women, do not have the same experience."What about people who don't know the law?" she said. "Standing up for myrights has just been a big headache."Staff Writer Giselle Goodman can be contacted at 324-4888 or at:ggoodman@pressherald.comTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com Your use of Yahoo!

But so longas I was the only one doing serious testing, it was a dubious idea to makethe code maximally clumsy for me to use on the c.l.py task <wink>.> Getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than I> though!  My own saved mail doesn't reflect what I receive, since I> save and throw away selectively (much more so than in the past :-).Yup, the system picks up on *everything* in the tokens.  Graham's proposed"delete as ham" and "delete as spam" keys would probably work very well formotivated geeks.  But Paul Svensson has pointed out here that they probablywouldn't work nearly so well for real people.>> Ah!  That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped.  I'd again>> offer to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get>> stripped here too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that>> would feel too much like a loss <wink>.> I'll bite.  Sounds like a good idea to strip the HTML in this case;> I'd like to see how this improves the f-p rate on this corpus.I'll soon check in this change:    def tokenize_body(self, msg, retain_pure_html_tags=False):                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^        """Generate a stream of tokens from an email Message.        If a multipart/alternative section has both text/plain and text/html        sections, the text/html section is ignored.  This may not be a good        idea (e.g., the sections may have different content).        HTML tags are always stripped from text/plain sections.        By default, HTML tags are also stripped from text/html sections.        However, doing so hurts the false negative rate on Tim's        comp.lang.python tests (where HTML-only messages are almost never        legitimate traffic).  If optional argument retain_pure_html_tags        is specified and True, HTML tags are retained in text/html sections.

URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/09.html#sixDate: 2002-10-09T19:54:41-05:00Actually, 5.6. I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds them, can you please let me know? Thank you. I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a runner. Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, then get invigorated and run another mile. And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and run. There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.

URL: http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/25#medicalNotesDate: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 12:49:48 GMTMixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=carotid+arteries&spell=1[2] http://www.vascularweb.org/doc/190

Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone.     "This is Frank Bellknap Long!" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a     lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on     this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English     Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated,     and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his     head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low.     "No reason! No corners!" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with     the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. "Our next song is about     Harlan Ellison!" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads,     and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy.     Blöödhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing     themselves as "edu-core," the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash     tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the     audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands     that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: "The Faster You Go     Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read."

One of the main strands of this 'modernisation' is to have all stations on a 'retained' basis at night. Basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire, the fire-fighters will be summonsed by pagers, the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions. The main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night. However, the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire-fighters' strike all occurred at night. Over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren't on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come. Currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live/work within one mile of the station. How they will apply this to whole time fire-fighters is still unclear. A good friend of mine is a station officer in Hampshire and currently lives 20 miles from his station so how he'll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery.  And I can't see many fire-fighters living within a mile of some of the inner London stations.DaveTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com Your use of Yahoo!

A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity     of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of     standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the     right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel     is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first,     but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's     flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that     feeling of loss. [1] http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0902a.html#osxbluesupdate

Best, Rohit===========================================================DataPower delivers XML acceleration deviceBy Scott Tyler ShaferAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PTDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses."Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. "The XA35 is the first of a family."Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML."Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly said. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. Firewalls are blind to XML today."Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware."Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes will be mostly false.Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration.The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises.=========================================================================DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.=========================================================================DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in FundingVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer in XML-Aware Networking for Web ServicesCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of Directors.DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology."Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of XML that is required to support next generation enterprise applications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower Technology."DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A single DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports."In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said Michael Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. "By turbo-charging their networks with DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls.""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and security," said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. "DataPower is on their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web services," said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. "DataPowers XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely on XML for mission critical applications."About Venrock AssociatesVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the Rockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs that now spans over seven decades.

"Finding the 'right' price point for a software platform is critical." To me this sounds like a fancy way of saying, "I groove all that stuff about how platforms need to be cheap and ubiquitous, but I can't bring myself to do it." The price, Ray says, "must be high enough both 1) to maintain a perception of value in the platform, and 2) to create significant margins well before ubiquity is assured so that the ecosystem is assured of the platform's ultimate viability." What he doesn't mention: if you lower the price on the only product you're selling, you have a revenue hit, which will not make your investors happy, and you may run out of money and have to close. But that must be what he's thinking.[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WorstProjectEver.html[2] http://www.ozzie.net/blog/stories/2002/09/24/softwarePlatformDynamics.html

"We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste     our Twinkie," said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled     treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of     Seattle.     As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add     chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top...     Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the     71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and     county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began     gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions.     How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an     estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much improved at being able to spot "interesting" at a distance.   Interesting isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of the candidates was "women, in order of attractiveness."   I flinched from that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if on the net all you have is a photo.....You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)It's too easy to say "Oh, no!  He's a geek!"   or "She's a CAT person, ick!" when you might have a great time together.We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of exposure shrinks after school.Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed DatingSpeed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much "interview" context and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort though. I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for you means that the traditional advice of "join activities groups" is actually sound.Eirikur

I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window managerand evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 yearsof customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one pointat UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached toanother WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, Ihad a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this alongwith SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I amreally enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frillsfirst look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  Thenumber of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] Afterless than an hour or two of "nesting" I already have almostall my menus and controls setup just the way I want. I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It'sa great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite thebullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

"It looked like a bison skull," the building contractor andamateur archaeologist recalls. "I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don'tlive this high up.' "Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from abisonone that died about 340 years ago. "This was an extraordinarydiscovery," says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that itcould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "There'sprobably a lot more like it yet to be found."And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers andsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peruto Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars andindustryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. Asthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts isemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deepfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the muckyfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of ourpredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued."It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced throughstudying these remains," says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitudearchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National GeographicSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discoveredin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "IceMan," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, haveoffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, asthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasionaltreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before MotherNatureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains candeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they'reoften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon themdon't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier inBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was adead animal. "It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. "But when I lookedcloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a furtrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Locbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumedthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and whatseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunterlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long AgoPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (whomay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved humanfrom the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region couldexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in thefirst place. "Before this there was no archaeological record of peopleliving here," says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. "Now wesee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedekcaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the southYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered incaribou dung. "It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't beencaribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls Kuzyk, then awildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found "what looked like apencil with string wrapped around it." It turned out to be a4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of theice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layercakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to theice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discardedsome equipment in the ice. "We've got people hunting with throwing dartsup until 1,200 years ago," says Hare, who now oversees the researchproject. "Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwingdarts."Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. Theyare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on whereglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known tohave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangelland St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciatedterrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawingEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite asthe Ice Man. "Global warming is providing us high-altitudearchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We'reprobably about the only ones happy about it."

This is due to insufficient write privileges to the "razor-agent.log" file. A quick work-around is to do a "chmod go+rx" on that file (of course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the "unblessed" error.Hope this helps,Michael DuffDavid Rees wrote:>This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so>I thought I'd give it a shot.

I added a modify time check thinking that it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache when that happens anyway.Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a [file mtime $filename] would be worth it.

If anyone here is running (null) beta then you may like these Gnome theme packages.They are enhanced and repackages from my previous theme packs, this time to conformto the way pre-release RH8 handles themes for GTK1 and GTK2.RedHat has a preferences -> themes app, but themes only show up there that have BOTHgtk1.2 (Gnome1) themes AND gtk1.4 (GTK2 aka Gnome2) themes available. Then RH willapply the theme to both GTK versions, so the user does not really notice thatdifferent GTK toolkit versions are being used, since they *should* look the same.This "gtk2-engines-compat" RPM has GTK2 ported themes for those themes that areincluded in the RH package "gtk-engines" themes pack for GTK1.The "gtk1+2-themez" pack mostly repackages my previous theme RPMs in a way that the(null) btea like, and supposedly the next RH8 when released :)forward - original mail:  From " Angles  Puglisi" <angles@aminvestments.com>  Date 09/01/2002 - 06:10:03 am  Subject some (null) eyecandy packages

The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input andoutput) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properlydesigned systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy forCSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to breakwith exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography exportrules at the time.Even more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xingplayer break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  Theyrapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithmwith an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacksmight have further reduced the strength).  This is another great exampleshowing why proprietary cryptography algorithms should be viewed withthe greatest of suspicion.On Tue, Sep 03, 2002 at 09:03:40PM -0400, Yannick Gingras wrote:> This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.They have > an internal procession unit around 4MHz.

You can put a limited amount of trust in a smart card.There have been any number of very clever attacks against smartcards(Ross Anderson in the UK has documented quite a few of these), andsmartcard manufactures are usually one step behind these attacks.  Awell designed system assumes that a system smartcard will be completelycompromised at some point, giving an adversary all of the secretscontained in the smartcard.  The cryptography industry has developed avariety of techniques that can reduce the impact of a compromise,including unique keys per smartcard and forward security techniques.Luciano Rocha [strange@nsk.yi.org] wrote: > The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy, but therest of> the PC isn't, so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock/smart card,or> peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated.Going back to the original question, once the encrypted material goesoutside the trusted hardware, it is impossible to "unbreakably" protectit.  There may be some mitigation steps you can take, such as the SDMIwatermarking, but most schemes to date have been easily broken.  Another consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect.While there is no such thing as unbreakable, adding more cost (both interms of price and hassle-factor) can greatly improve the protection.Since you are talking about the use of standard PC workstations, Ipresume what you are trying to protect is not THAT valuable.

Even then, those relics werewell on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstartshave banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.  It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.  The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which hasbeen hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break awayfrom the Microsoft monopoly....     - http://finance.lycos.com/home/news/story.asp?story=28928829

I thought it was looking for> clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't> exactly 0.5?There's a brief discussion of this before the definition ofMAX_DISCRIMINATORS.  All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB aresaved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.Then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number ofclues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS ofthem.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the finalprobability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the listof clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manualreview is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longerMAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that'swhy you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.Before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened toappear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.>> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!> This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few> similar ones.I just beat it <wink>:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignorespunctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both wordbigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with alist of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!

It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in the sidebar, but thebody> text was a serious discussion of "OO and soft coding" with lots of highly> technical words as clues (including Zope and ZEO).No matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.Ditto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique "words" that get0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption ofconditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., theprobability that "<body>" appears in a message is highly correlated with theprob of "<br>" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayesgrossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing youget in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>.Read the "What about HTML?" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,I've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted atpython.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue tojustify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven't done anythinggeared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list emailthat happens to go through python.org.I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that itstill had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full testresults with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the "What aboutHTML?" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n ratereductions.  I should test that again now.> Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?Almost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in bothheaders and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the basetokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.> Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make> progress there?I would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailmanheader decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudgingthe data is a Mortal Sin and I haven't changed a byte so far), and my spamtoo polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  Inparticular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they'regoing to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don't even catch"undisclosed recipients" in the To header now!).> ...> No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:>>   multipart/mixed>       text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))>       text/html         (long HTML copied from website)Ah!  That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped.  I'd again offerto add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped heretoo, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much likea loss <wink>.>> This seems confused: Jeremy didn't use my trained classifier pickle,>> he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora.>> ...> I think it's still corpus size.I reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams frommy corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predictingon sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the errorrates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 ofeach.Ah, a full test run just finished, on the   tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and stripsa   trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigramsThis is the code:            # Tokenize everything in the body.            lastw = ''            for w in word_re.findall(text):                n = len(w)                # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().                if 3 <= n <= 12:                    if w[-1] == 's':                        w = w[:-1]                    yield w                    if lastw:                        yield lastw + w                    lastw = w + ' '                elif n >= 3:                    lastw = ''                    for t in tokenize_word(w):                        yield twhere    word_re = re.compile(r"[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+")This at least doubled the process size over what's done now.  It helped thef-n rate significantly, but probably hurt the f-p rate (the f-p rate is toolow with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small*absolute* magnitude -- 0.025% is a single message in the f-p table):false positive percentages    0.000  0.000  tied    0.000  0.075  lost  +(was 0)    0.050  0.125  lost  +150.00%    0.025  0.000  won   -100.00%    0.075  0.025  won    -66.67%    0.000  0.050  lost  +(was 0)    0.100  0.175  lost   +75.00%    0.050  0.050  tied    0.025  0.050  lost  +100.00%    0.025  0.000  won   -100.00%    0.050  0.125  lost  +150.00%    0.050  0.025  won    -50.00%    0.050  0.050  tied    0.000  0.025  lost  +(was 0)    0.000  0.025  lost  +(was 0)    0.075  0.050  won    -33.33%    0.025  0.050  lost  +100.00%    0.000  0.000  tied    0.025  0.100  lost  +300.00%    0.050  0.150  lost  +200.00%won   5 timestied  4 timeslost 11 timestotal unique fp went from 13 to 21false negative percentages    0.327  0.218  won    -33.33%    0.400  0.218  won    -45.50%    0.327  0.218  won    -33.33%    0.691  0.691  tied    0.545  0.327  won    -40.00%    0.291  0.218  won    -25.09%    0.218  0.291  lost   +33.49%    0.654  0.473  won    -27.68%    0.364  0.327  won    -10.16%    0.291  0.182  won    -37.46%    0.327  0.254  won    -22.32%    0.691  0.509  won    -26.34%    0.582  0.473  won    -18.73%    0.291  0.255  won    -12.37%    0.364  0.218  won    -40.11%    0.436  0.327  won    -25.00%    0.436  0.473  lost    +8.49%    0.218  0.218  tied    0.291  0.255  won    -12.37%    0.254  0.364  lost   +43.31%won  15 timestied  2 timeslost  3 timestotal unique fn went from 106 to 94

Note thatthe battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each runanyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.200 MPH should be no problem.- Adam L.

http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB10327475102363433,00.htmlThe Wall Street JournalSeptember 23, 2002COMMENTARYRebuild at Ground ZeroBy LARRY SILVERSTEINEarlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of thehorrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those whoperished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towersand a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civicamenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguishthat those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,indeed, for all of us.But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus squarefeet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towersmust be replaced on the site.About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was theeconomic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firmshave relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. NewYork City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficitmay become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain thevibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towersmade a powerful statement to the world that said, "This is New York, asymbol of our free economy and of our way of life." That is why they weredestroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, andwith buildings that make a potent architectural statement.In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from manysources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but onall of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million squarefeet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, orsimply never rebuilt.These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must berecovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except overthe towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, theoffice and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancybefore 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development hasremotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subwayand PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvementsplanned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct"Train-to-the-Plane" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomeseven more the logical locus of office development.And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a taskforce of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former TreasurySecretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate theanticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers onlyheightens the need.As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtowncannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out thathistory shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet ofoffice space. All new construction underway already is substantially leasedup. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at thebeginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center siteover a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming online until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is anannual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'rate.Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that itpreviously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering anextended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, norwill most New Yorkers.Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Timesthat the city "has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for thefuture." I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architecturalsignificance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls whathappened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well asresidents of the area.The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firmwhose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.-- -----------------R. A.

Redhat of course doesnt count asportable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model doesdefinately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select topoint at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIXis just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocessmultithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes outof it. Bottom line is the "do stuff when something happens" model turned outto be right, and the UNIX "look for something to do and keep looking tillyou find it no matter how many times you have to look" is not really workingso great anymore.- Adam L.

Related anecdote:I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  Eventually his story came out.He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and lefthim, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,asking random asians for help finding her.I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was thatthe possibility of mutual exploitation is high.Anecdote number two:In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked withwho was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Amongother odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff likeoffering them flowers.I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman whowasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get amail order bride.I was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as muchas anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.

Jason Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in general) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. _Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format formerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. _Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It isn't RDF. It's just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an impediment to mainstream acceptance. _Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I'm not buying into RSS 0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0.

Dear sir,,My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. TheoDuba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from SouthAfrican Information exchange Johannesburg..Due to the previous war against white farmers inZimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supportersto claim all the white owned farms in our country, heordered all the White owned farmers to surrender alltheir farms to his party members and his followers. Myfather was a victim of this oppression and inhumanbehavior as he was one of the richest farmers in ourcountry,my fayher was totaly against the act by thepresidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded myfathers farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrestedhim and confiscated all his investment.Early last year when this victimization of whitefarmers by president Mugabe started, my late fatherenvisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost allhis money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out ofZimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in aprivate security company through the help of hislawyer here in South Africa without revealing the realcontents of the box to the security company, then,went back home. He registered the box as familytreasure.While he was still in detention that led to his deathdue to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in SouthAfrica because of the escalation of the crisis inZimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. Hewas arrested on the 5th of March last year.Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th ofDecember 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating anddepressing because my fathers lawyer is presentlyhospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;though the lodgment documents are with me, as such Iwant to relocate to your country for good.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2220132.stmTuesday, 27 August, 2002, 21:35 GMT 22:35 UKCambodia temple ruins yield treasureWorkers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda innorthern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in goodcondition and believed to be hundreds of years old.They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich templeabout 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn downduring the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area becameovergrown.Community careDeputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,when the last temple was fully operating," Mr Hang Sithim said.Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearbytown for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at thetemple to take care of them.''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor ofKampong Thom province.''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''Reign of terrorA police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 andcontrolled the country between 1975 and 1979.The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadentor culturally impure.About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodiainto a farmers' utopia. ------------------------ Yahoo!

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.         Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika.          Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________Powered by List BuilderTo unsubscribe follow the link:http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4

Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for     your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do     so, practically essential. Then they explain how:     "Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed," said Joel Joves, a designer with     offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. "If you have a fabulous study     or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with     decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a     room."

If you need to store a database password, thenclearly the first step is to store the text outside theweb tree.  You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere,so that at least an attacker has to get two different things.Also, don't get full privileges - create a user account thatis GRANTed very limited access.However, you can often do better than this if securityis critical.  Create a separate program which has thesedatabase keys (as noted above), and make the web programcontact IT.  Create a very limited protocol that ONLYlets you do the operations you need (you can add specificoperations later).  There's a performance hit, which you'retrading for improved data isolation.Giorgio Zoppi wrote:> On Fri, Aug 23, 2002, David Wheeler wrote:> > >>The standard way to store passwords is... not to>>store passwords.

from http://www.arstechnica.com/"There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Departmentof Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits againstindividuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrightedmaterial over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believesthat "criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary topreserve the viability of America's content industries." Malcolm alsobelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they areparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who downloadcopyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisionssuch as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to seebusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution ofcopyrighted works."Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I thinkthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminalprosecution," said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the sameconference panel.I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman ishoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits orwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minordeterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuitscarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generatefurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult toinitiate because of the "schooling" effect of millions of systemsparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out fromthe crowd.The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which definesillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully forpurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by thereproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or morecopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distributionof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establishwillful infringement....The term "financial gain" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, ofanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as "financial gain"even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how thevalue of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from theperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.The statute of limitations:507. Limitations on actions(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintainedunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within fiveyears after the cause of action arose.(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under theprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years afterthe claim accrued.The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found inSection 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-timecriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people toprosecute because of the aforementioned "schooling" effect, but my guesswould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominentindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will betargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have > endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he > ever coined it.An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* FAQ) and "eyewitness" reporting without a single written source. What the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much more skeptical if the "quote" emerged after his death... RK===============================================================http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm"A billion here, a billion there . . ."Did Dirksen ever say, " A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money"? (or anything very close to that?)Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him.Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations.Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed "Ev and Charlie" and "Ev and Jerry" shows, all newspapers clippings in the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word "pothole" to remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling:"As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic hazard."Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said, I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'" [Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another "spending" story, one he labeled "cat in the well":"One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, Johnny, a cat fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the well?'"Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while, and then when the teacher came down and said, How are you getting along?' Johnny said, Teacher, if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes I can land that cat in hell.'"If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do not find much to cheer about concerning it." [Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].But there are no such reminders for the "A billion here, a billion there . . . " tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no authoritative reference to the "billion" phrase.The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up nothing in the way of confirmation.The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, "The favorite sum of money is $1 billion  a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there." [EMD Papers, Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the "and pretty soon you're talking real money" is missing.In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted Dirksen: "Look at education  two-and-one-half billion  a billion for this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. You'll be deeply in the red." [Cited in Byron Hulsey's "Everett Dirksen and the Modern Presidents," Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of Texas, p. 226]Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and career  he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped capture.Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he ever coined it.  ---My permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu

They did decline to mentionthat the demand for some trades  is so great that some ofthem are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - the average salary fora university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonderhalf of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call centers thathave arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) anhour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental differenceis that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people,  union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is that we are the thin edge(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of third-world wages and work practices coming to North America.I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they could maintain that (and prosper) just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can votewith my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anywayeventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired employees were brought in by the employer (rumours werethat they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, guess what - used to be a VP at the company.That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as longas the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in place.And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding aboutthe labor markets here.>>BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,>*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,>all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and>there would be *more* self-made people on that list.

A particularly galling example ishigh-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricingapproaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the telecom industry (maintain yourmonopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators) meet.Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thingseems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than usingregulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few.>>In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not>theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and>redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is just>that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.>>To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx>wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.>  >I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like they're the biggest believers inthe Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the rights of that "proletariat" you'vejust created with bogus "law and order" policies , concentrate capital in the hands of a few (ideally peoplewho can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, and lie - usethe word "compassionate" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actuallyhelps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the Republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining standards of living) is the reality.Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:"Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households"Owen

This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater "Sensitivity / Responsiveness" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature "smokables" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This "Shangrila" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass! must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves "potent significance" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after "flowering" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all "viripotent," which makes this "gnarly stoke" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve "viripotency" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, "sensitive/responsive", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking ("Smoka") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!* Mill-stoned & honed.* Depressive regressive!* Psychologically uplifting!* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!* Sophisticated, well-balanced "ambiance."* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.* "Potentiated" & viripotent!* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.* Easy on, easy off!* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!* No "munchie" factor.* No failed drug tests!Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly "SweetGrass" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent "Smoka", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of "Smoka" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent "Sensitive / Responsive" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) "Sensitive/Responsive" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy.

Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy.

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.         Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika.          Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________Powered by List BuilderTo unsubscribe follow the link:http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=54EE057E0B6864FB&m=5

Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other men. http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html<<For example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women is approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an individual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we find an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than the mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >>As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.Tom
Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) overregulation.The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.It also has the ability to single out particular people, while overspending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be anexample of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spendingtons of money on public housing.As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to imposeboth, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion thatEITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is prettymuch anathema to liberal politics.Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for muchgovernment regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no privatereplacements, no government regulation) is better than governmentregulation itself.And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does notinclude everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is awatermelon.> -----Original Message-----> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf OfGeege> Schuman> > funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally> irresponsible.  which do you think is the worse indictment -> overregulation> or overspending?  there are many (dickheads) who buy into the> neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of "liberal" as "one whoseeks> to> impose both."

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46455-2002Oct5.htmlA New Theory on Mapping the New WorldBy Guy GugliottaWashington Post Staff WriterMonday, October 7, 2002; Page A07In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary mapof the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus andothers into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent"America." With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.But there was something else. What would later come to be called SouthAmerica and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on theeast coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast-- which no European was known to have seen.The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction ofmodern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the rightgeographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printedalong its top.The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of thecurvature of the Earth.It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- waspublished six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus ofPanama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around theworld.Did someone get there earlier?...------------------------ Yahoo!

Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type "make" after I get the output from the ./configure. However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing * cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config* make oldconfig* make depThe 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed "make", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after "make". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directoryThe odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated.

No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset production needed for today's most demanding games.

I think thelaws specialing out hate and protected speechare ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to makeis that there's only two types, speech and action. I agree, they are all speech and should be covered by the First Amendment, butIf hate speech is so protected, why are certainstates trying to prosecute people for it?  There'sonly two answers and one of them is wrong.  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to     have a different level of protection dictated     by whoever's offended at the time.  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by      any reasonable person. Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really "threat".  I thinkthey let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantagein being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty andmoney through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEYdon't like.

Gary Lawrence Murphy:>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I usedthe term "alcoholism," implying addiction. Idrink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drinkdon't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AAmeetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky inalmost any degree. Were I single, I might considerpotential mates who partook of the less irrationalor more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian orBuddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccanof the second. But someone who is both irrationaland serious about that irrationality strikes me asa bad choice of partner, moreso than someone whowas addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drugaddicts at least have the sense to battle theirproblem, and to keep their children from sufferingit. The religious revel in their irrationality,and want to raise their children in it. That's adifficult difference for two parents toreconcile.Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored ofsomeone who has no religious tendencies._________________________________________________________________Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com

I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.

Dear Sir,I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contractaward and review committee set up by the federalgovernment of Nigeria under the new civiliandispensation to award new contracts and reviewexisting ones.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable andreputable person to handle a very confidentialtransaction, which involves the transfer of a hugesum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry infavor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sumof US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand UnitedState Dollars). This amount has now been approved andis now ready to be transferred being that thecompaniesthat actually executed these contracts have beenfully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account forsubsequent disbursement, since we as civil servantsare prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civilservice law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trustreposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside forincidental expenses (internal and external) betweenboth parties in the course of the transaction you willbe mandated to remit the balance to other accountsin due course. Modalities have been worked out at the highest levelof the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fundswithin 7 working days subject to your satisfaction ofthe above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves andfor mutual security of the funds the whole approvalprocedures will officially and legally processedwith your name or the name of any company you maynominate as the bonefide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having putin over twenty-five years in the civil service of mycountry, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated withutmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assistby sending me a reply to this email to state your position on thistransaction, if favorable we will take further stepsto brief you the full details of this viable transaction. I want to assure you that this business proposal is100% risk free as we have done our homeworkproperly. I quite believe that you will protect our interestby taking this deal strictly confidential, as we arestill in government service, which we intend toretire from in full honor.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule toenable us include this transfer in the next batchwhich would constitute the new quarter paymentsfor the 2002 financial year. Thank you and God bless.Dr James Alabi

You don't have to.  Shortof Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, includingreading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae foranyone who can show otherwise.An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.  If your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on theline before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffersniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.The only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --maybe -- Palladium.- Lucashttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Type a few  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but justthe mouse.Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and shouldbe easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something likeshift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than addingkey bindings.But note there's no need to "undo" - the way I generally use link, ifthe desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, isto right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,(and because I have the "automatic move to the next message on move orlink option set) select the message again, and then "Link".Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at atime, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of thoseimplicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannotachieve a "move" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs tobe link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).  | How's spring shaping up "down under"?No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm toldthat where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been betterduring the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.

It seems there's two kinds of people, those who will go online with the status quo, and those who won't: Canada levels out at 53%, the USA at 59% (since 2000!), Denmark flatlines at 60%, Norway at 54%, Sweden at 64%, and the UK at 55% ... only Iceland continues unfettered beyond 60%. Could this be evidence of a usability barrier? If so, it's a clear signal that there's as much fortune to be gained from a substantially new Internet interface than all that has been gained so far.Latest guestimate stats from Ireland's NUA show a flattening Internet population growth.

I am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.Mike Chris Haun wrote:i though this was all rather interesting, first bit of 9/11 coverage that i've liked.http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/09/11/forbidden_letters/index.htmlChris---------------------------------Do you Yahoo!?Yahoo!

Danny and Quinn and their rommie Gilbert are just about the most fun Bay Areans I've had the pleasure of hanging out with. Between the three of them, they're capable of being entertaining on the subjects of Python, copyright, pottery, usability (a conversation with Quinn about usability made it, almost verbatim, into my second novel "Eastern Standard Tribe"), load-balancing, free software, nerd culture, British cuisine, bodily ailments, pregnancy...

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85511986Date: Not suppliedThe T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I really think I'm going to pick this up.     That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current     competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same     spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively     high- speed "GPRS" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious     surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice     time is another story -- more on that later.)     Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and     will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing     hybrids focus on "enterprise" customers -- the big businesses that are     supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most     clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their     own words, "Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to     34-year-old demographic." I am that demographic!

I'm not a C programmer,but I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) areinstructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compileprocess, and include all sorts of symbols/functionse.g. "#include <math.h>" gives you maths type functions.  Since theystart with "#" they are ignored in the final compilation.Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtelsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriatedirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you topersuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think thisis the right way to proceed.Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding "make dep" and so forthshould have been performed in the directory where the make process islooking for modversions.h & Co.I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory asyou describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which youhave done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, afterthat, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those filesdon't really belong there).For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successfulcompilation.m> > Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed "make", I noticed> that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h> file.

These addresses are all over the 70-some different ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c.

An old Indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago.http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A58173-2002Mar7&notFound=trueSlaughter in the Name of GodBy Salman RushdieFriday, March 8, 2002; Page A33 Washington PostThe defining image of the week, for me, is of a small child's burned and blackened arm, its tiny fingers curled into a fist, protruding from the remains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in India. The murder of children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily killings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in Nellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring village . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the horrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination: They bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in evidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in kerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length of wood.I say "our" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves India deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is potentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India's strengths, then India's sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? Good. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India undergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a decade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed or disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men's unwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to religion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to the same sentiments as the nation in general.Meanwhile, India's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. (It has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), or Indian People's Party, and the Hindu extremists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some international commentators, such as Britain's Independent newspaper, urge us to "beware excess pessimism."The horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we're used to it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That's how life is, folks. Most of the time India is the world's largest secular democracy; and if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we mustn't let that distort the picture.Of course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, when a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu fanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists' hands.The VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and insufficient radicalism of India's BJP government. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP's more extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. But it isn't working anymore. In state elections across the country, the BJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP firebrands. Why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success?The electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark that lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the site of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that's where the Godhra dead were coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, tragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee has insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and wrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.The distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India's president, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP hard-liner) as well as the central government for doing "too little too late." She pins the blame firmly on the "motivated, well-planned out and provocative actions" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the violence erupted, denounced India's Muslims en masse and praised the nationalist movement.The murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in her letter demands "stern legal action" against them. But the VHP is determined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such public pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting them, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces the Nobel award.The political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there's something beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face: namely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is the poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no excuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in the fashionable language of "respect." What is there to respect in any of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around the world in religion's dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And when we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results makes it easier to do it again.So India's problem turns out to be the world's problem. What happened in India has happened in God's name. The problem's name is God.Salman Rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay collection "Step Across This Line."© 2002 The Washington Post Companysdw-- sdw@lig.net http://sdw.stStephen D.

Good idea!This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love todevote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addressesto giving the Chinese unfettered net access.In a sense, this is what the "peek-a-booty" project does:   http://www.peek-a-booty.orgBut let's play out the next few moves:Good Guys: Google enables SSL access Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domainsGood Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty) Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewallGood Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish           softwareGood Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using           monitoring-disabling-software...and on and on.The best we can hope is that technological cleverness, by raising thecosts of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression, bringssocial liberalization sooner rather than later.- Gordon----- Original Message -----From: "Rohit Khare" <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>To: <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:44 PMSubject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with thearticle I was commenting on... Rohit]In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week ("TheSearch Goes On", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the mostsubversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, whichmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. Bymaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforcethese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and fromGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost allWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading toSSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer inChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range ofIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on inthe article.Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this trafficcosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the freeflow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governorssponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the restof the Web?To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sectorprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Justimagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secureaccess to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedomof the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and mostof it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...Best,   Rohit Khare===========================================================The search goes onChina backtracks on banning Googleup to a pointSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING From The Economist print editionIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population ofInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is provingan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blockedaccess to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparentlybecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access toforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has beenrestored.An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. Moresophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult touse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken byGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way forChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet usersposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internetproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google siteto far less powerful search engines in China.Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts tocensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blockingindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to befiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for keywords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier thisweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search onGoogle for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in Chinausually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a searchalso rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.
There seem to be two "drivers" for the classifier now: Neale Pickett'shammie.py, and the original GBayes.py.  According to the README.txt,GBayes.py hasn't been kept up to date.  Is there anything in therethat isn't covered by hammie.py?  About the only useful feature ofGBayes.py that hammie.py doesn't (yet) copy is -u, which calculatesspamness for an entire mailbox.  This feature can easily be copiedinto hammie.py.  (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers;but timtoken.py rules, so I'm not sure how interesting that is now.)Therefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.Anyone against?  (I imagine that Skip or Barry might have a stake inGBayes.py; Tim seems to have moved all code he's working to othermodules.)--Guido van Rossum (home page: http://www.python.org/~guido/)

Hettinga" <rah@shipwright.com>Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulationSender: <dbs@philodox.com>http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan GillmorMercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energyindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justifysoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financialand fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning whateveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federaladministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezedsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days afterCalifornia's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricitygenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully workedthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in amemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy torelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving anycongestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to beseen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits andpolicy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to thinkthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its leastfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love oftraditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear anyfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts thestate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's areasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea ifit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put theutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center forEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we couldachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a betterjob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way toinject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricitydefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulationis essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougerscontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more ofboth.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets upthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilitieswill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewablesources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customermodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newerideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, smallgenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology iscoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through taxincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn'tdone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers didreact to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it'slunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid italtogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, sogrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, aremaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the comingwar in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program todrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energysystem. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in itsown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where ithurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe nextyear.-- -----------------R. A.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85483138Date: Not suppliedArticle about a scam expert who belives the mom who beat her child is a grifter belonging to the Irish Travelers. The reason she beat up her little girl, he thinks, is becasue she was pissed that the kid blew her con at a toy store.     Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. "The little     girl gave away the scam to an employee or the mom was so ticked off at not     getting refunds she took it out on the little girl."

Then for your custom built kernel, simply "./configure--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver" from thealsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run "depmod -a".Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-neededdrivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his ownkernel.I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516085Date: Not suppliedWe did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with Tim O'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV recorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who's working on a book on fair use and copyfights. Glenn "802.11b Networking News" Fleishman took great notes through the talk:     Dan: Tim, you're a "content or copyright holdertalk about these issues."     Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US.     Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is     wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over     for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the     author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc.     Oblivion is fate of most books: "Piracy would be the best thing for those     books." People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally     like to respect the rights of creators. "Piracy is a marginal act; it takes     away some of the cream."     Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a     publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a     publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often     very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and     position in bookstores.     Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will     Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else?     Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media     companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're     stuck for a long time with "some mistakes."

Folks, my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux. Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard diskfor Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which wentfine except it didn't pick up my monitor. I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's defaultset. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), butit still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next? Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch isinactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead. If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas. Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?

Bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the 21st century.This is the presidents story of September 11th and the week America went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he remembers Sept. 11.I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission, but not me, Mr. Bush says during the Air Force One interview. Not me. I made the pledge to myself and to people that Im not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So long as Im president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack.Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane been so central to America in a crisis.For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet engines echoed in Manhattan.Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.I thought it was an accident, says Mr. Bush. I thought it was a pilot error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a terrible mistake.Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack.Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the news on his pager. The presidents chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack, Card told the presidentWhen he said those words, what did he see in the Presidents face?I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said, Card recalls. I think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander-in-chief, not just as president.What was going through Bushs mind when he heard the news?Were at war and somebody has dared attack us and were going to do something about it, Mr. Bush recalls. I realized I was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident that we were, you know, that the world had changed.Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation."Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America, he said in the speech. Today, weve had a national tragedy.It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didnt know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent ran in.He said to me, Sir, we have to leave immediately and grabbed, put a hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office, Cheney recalls. Im not sure how they do it, but they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.There wasnt a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice president, says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. We knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction, he says.Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice called Mr. Bush.It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the West Wing, says Rice. They were hurrying me off the phone with the president and I just said, he said, Im coming back and we said Mr. President that may not be wise. I remember stopping briefly to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, Im fine. You have to tell everybody that Im fine but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I think the thing that was on everybodys mind was how many more planes are coming.The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the White House, no matter what.Its important to emphasize it's not personal, you dont think of it in personal terms, youve got a professional job to do, says Cheney.Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital.Says Mineta: Someone came in and said Mr. Vice president theres a plane 50 miles out, then he came in and said Its now 10 miles out, we dont know where it is exactly, but its coming in low and fast.It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bushs limousine sped toward Air Force One in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run, and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole White House just flooded out, she recalls.In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling a Secret Service agent Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters protected. At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications Director Dan Bartlett was on board.It was like a rocket, he remembers. For a good ten minutes, the plane was going almost straight up.At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel, concrete and human lives.Someone said to me, Look at that I remember that, Look at that and I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment, recalls Rice of the TV newscast.She also felt something in her gut: That weve lost a lot of Americans and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of course I felt the anger.Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down. I discussed it with the president, Cheney recalls. Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked? He said yes.It was my advice. It was his decision, says Cheney.Thats a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft, says Bush. But it was an easy decision to make given the  given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it was, I didnt hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be done.The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too, says Rice.Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin.The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure location somewhere in Washington. I was horrified, she says. I thought, Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can. It was a nightmare.By 10:30 a.m., Americas largest city was devastated, its military headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf Coast.I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the United States, says President Bush. I didnt need any legal briefs, I didnt need any consultations, I knew we were at war.Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says the president. "Information was just flying from all directions.Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bushs ranch.I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of different information, says Card.They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, Angel is next. The threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get the president home, Tillman says. We actually have to consider everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is.Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from air traffic control  a suspect airliner was dead ahead.Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with, Tillman remembers.Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought that was a good idea, except the president.I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back, says Bush.So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in Nebraska. Back in Washington, the presidents closest advisor, Karen Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. Bush.And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, sounded very shaken said, Maam, Im sorry, we cant reach Air Force One. Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didnt recognize.There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to see something like that in, in our nation's capital, says Hughes.When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. I knew it was a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, Hello? and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to the location where I met the vice president.On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He didnt want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the telephone.We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were heading, says Tillman. We, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly across the United States.'Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning each other to keep the route secret.OK, wheres he going? one tower radioed to another.Just watch him, a second tower responded. Dont question him wheres he's going. Just work him and watch him, theres no flight plan in and were not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed back: Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 oclock position.The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows, says Bartlett. And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander wouldnt tell them where they were going.He just said, 'Youll know when you see it,' and that was my first clue, I didnt have any idea what we were going up until that point, says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.We, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force One, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles, says Roberts.Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft, or for his own safety: I looked out the airplane and saw two F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us.We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He hadnt appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, The American people want to know where their dang president is. The staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless, Bush said to the nation from Barksdale.At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had a job for press secretary Fleischer.The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed, says FleischerFleischers notes capture Mr. Bushs language, plain and unguarded. To the vice president he said: Were at war, Dick, were going to find out who did this and kick their ass. Another time, Mr. Bush said, Were not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.The President adds, I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I said, Were going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you and Dick Myers, who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, are going to go get them.By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below.At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground Command Center. It was built to transmit a presidents order to go to nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls that Tenent answered: Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. Were doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers. That was the first piece of hard evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination, says Mueller.In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had enough. He decided to come back.At one point, he said he didnt want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of Washington, Fleischer says. That verbatim.On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America collapsed, one of the nations worst days wore into evening. At the World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil, Bush said recently.Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the way to the White House.Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White House to return to? I dont remember thinking about whether or not the White House would have been obliterated," he recalls. "I think I might have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to take our best shot.Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff were already working on the speech.He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance, remembers Hughes. We had to show resolve, we had to reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. Bush didnt think the American people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that.He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty million Americans were watching.Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts, he said from the Oval Office that night.The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White House daily log: The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. We think it's Osama bin Laden.(CBS) When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the president would do. In office for just eight months, hed never been tested as commander-in-chief.I never asked them what they thought, President Bush said of the Pentagon brass, because I didnt really  because I knew what I was gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and bring them to justice.In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: The deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war, he said.To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin Ladens organization well before Sept. 11.The president said, You know Im tired of swatting at flies, I need a strategy to eliminate these guys, Rice recalls.In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didnt pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for came too late.Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for was literally headed to the presidents desk, I think, on the eleventh, tenth or eleventh, of September.On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in the past.Well, theres a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway, Mr. Bush tells Pelley. A lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense (Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called boots on the ground. That if youre gonna go to war, then youve gotta go to war with all your assets.The president says he wanted to fight and win a guerilla war with conventional means.It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the Taliban government.Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.As I like to describe it to my friends, Powell says, we had on the ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the best in the world. How do you connect it all?The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day before, he had called the Pentagon the mightiest building in the world. Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.He wasnt real receptive to that, to that recommendation, remembers Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. And he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening and thats what he did.The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it, says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning.And I just scribbled a little note to him, Powell recalls, and I said, Mr. President, Ive learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up. He looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said, The Secretary of State told me not to break down at the memorial service, and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. I wanted the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.It also stirred the mourners resolve, as Rice remember. As we stood to sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic, she says, you could feel the entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for what he encountered there.You couldnt brief me, you couldnt brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it," Mr. Bush says. It was like  it was ghostly. Like youre having a bad dream and youre walking through the dream.The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant, USA! USA!.There was a lot of bloodlust, the president recalls. People were, you know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, Dont you ever forget this, Mr. President. Dont let us down. The scene was very powerful. Very powerful.When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, We cant hear you.The president responded, I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; hed posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the presidents helicopter landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead  lost at ground zero.When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall.People said to me, Hell come out. Dont worry, Mr. president, well see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - hell find a place to survive underneath the rubble and well get him out. I, on the other hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, This is incredibly sad because the loved ones wont come out.One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the boy, Your daddy wont believe that I was here, so you show him that autograph.It was an effort to provide a little hope, the president recalls. I still get emotional thinking about it because were dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved theirwives who loved their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my tears, I see opportunity.The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground zero.I called the police department, Howard remembers,  and they said he hadnt called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, No, I dont need to call back. If he hadnt called in, I knew where he was.George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldnt stay away. The police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me, Howard recalls. And he extends his sympathy to me and thats when I asked him Id like to present Georges shield to him in honor of all the men and women who were killed over there.By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.He was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted, recalls Card..The next day  Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.My message is for everybody who wears the uniform  get ready. The United States will do what it takes, Mr. Bush told them.As Powell remembers it, He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. On the other hand, he says, I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the cabinet what he was planning.I wanted to just think it through, Mr. Bush remembers. Any time you commit troops to harms way, a president must make sure that he fully understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just spend some time on it alone. And did.What were his reservations?Mr. Bush says, Could we win? I didnt want to be putting our troops in there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.Nine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened, Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. Well remember the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end.A year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.In his desk, the president says, I have a classified document that might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about whos out there, where they might beAnd as the terrorists are captures or killed? I might make a little check there, yeah, Mr. Bush admits.But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list  Osama bin Laden.(CBS) A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, on his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we still dont have Osama Bin Laden?President Bush: How do you know that? I dont know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. I dont know that. Hes not leading a lot of parades. And hes not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is  were slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that hates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I always knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. Were after these people one at the time. Theyre killers. Period.Pelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or alive?Mr. Bush: If he were dead, theres somebody else to replace him. And we would find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al Qaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary so that people dont feel like theyve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives.Pelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? Certainly, weve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda has been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have gotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.Mr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their life. But I understand war. We did everything we can to  everything we could to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a mistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for which Im extremely proud. No,  I dont second guess things. Its  things never go perfect in a time of war.Pelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?Mr. Bush: Im committed to regime change.Pelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for example. Even your fathers former national security advisor, Mr. Scowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your estimation that they dont understand about the Iraq question that you do appreciate?Mr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasnt changed. I get all kinds of advice. Im listening to the advice. I appreciate the consultations. And well consult with a lot of people but our policy hasnt changed.Pelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.Mr. Bush: Yeah.Pelley: I dont think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same time, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for political reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the oil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy that youre considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United States.Mr. Bush: Hmm. Well, Im working for peace in the Middle East. Im the first president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly declared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace. Ive made it clear that in order for there to be peace the Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. I've also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that theyve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward it. Were more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it as well. But all this business isnt going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight off terror.Pelley: Arafat has to go?Mr. Bush: Either, hes, hes been a complete failure as far as I am concerned. Utter disappointment.Pelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.Mr. Bush: YeahPelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your administrations decision to close certain deportation hearings. They said, quote, A government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the Constitution. Where do you draw the line sir?Mr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. But we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, confines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.Pelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you as an idea that youve thought, No, thats too far. I dont wanna go"Mr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the Justice Department. I think that Attorney Generals doing a fine job, by the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make, I think thats fine. I mean, thats good. Its healthy. Its part of America.Pelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of four freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want and freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from fear?Mr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. Weve got more work to do.Pelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?Mr. Bush: I dont think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their governments doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack well deal with it. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, well alert people. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads. And the American people need to go about their lives. It seems like they are.

Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency  by have some play with time and valueMost people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's  called congnitive dissonance theoryMost businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaroundfrom technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only wayinconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. The local information when combined with the technicaltroubles of providing "just enough" forced synchronizationto remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones whenconcerns are more immedidate.  Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is howpeople cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarilypre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neckwho thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that thewhole world would be a little more perfect and everything,including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistentlybe in its proper place.Greg

Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which havechanged.Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.  In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.Chris-- Chris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/virCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com716 Congress, Suite 200Austin, TX  78701		+1 512 374 0500  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.

[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the article I was commenting on... Rohit]In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week ("The Search Goes On", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article.Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest of the Web?To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...Best,   Rohit Khare===========================================================The search goes onChina backtracks on banning Googleup to a pointSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING From The Economist print editionIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been restored.An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site to far less powerful search engines in China.Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in Chinausually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.

"the historical record", by which you mean *human* historical record, ishighly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geologicaltimescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that thesupposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absoluteterms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noisefloor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rateof temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of globaltemperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degreehere or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that globaltemperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain whytemperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the lastcouple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geologicalstandards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to useclimate to push a particular social agenda.It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers depositedduring the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence ofhumans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glacierspaved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into abit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buriedin and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by theice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to "savethe glaciers" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that theirexistence has always been transient.For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations areanthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'lljust stick with Occam's Razor for now.In my humble opinion.Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.comOn Mon, 2002-09-23 at 12:23, Jim Whitehead wrote:> > For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the> dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global> temperature.

KEVIN GEORGEABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIEWEST AFRICADearest one,Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebelsin my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving nextof kin to my father.But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such atime that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helpingme to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684I remain yours sincerely,KEVIN GEORGE                                                                            ---------------------------------Yahoo!

I use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it tothe relevant folder using rcvstore.Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to acceptmail from the new location.There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at thetop of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)That does not make a difference.It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail frommy spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need toconfigure that probably.Any idea how I would do this?ThanksSiva_______________________________________________Exmh-users mailing listExmh-users@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

Dude,it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.What's more, OSS is fully "imitated", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmmswith alsa module) to my ear.The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have thatautomatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsaalways was "muted" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possibleMatthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1stinstall, that was a long time ago for me.Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, butit's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.--That's "angle" as in geometry._______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided toput it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in thecorner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orangeLED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googlingI found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dellspecific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old ATpower connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo probor a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I wantto install Linux on it when I get it working.

Of course they had to do this AFTER we purcahsed these all on vhs, and yesit is now run by the great evil empire known as disney...but we got thenew School House Rocks DVD anyway and man is it an amazing item.First off , my 8 year old has been singing them since she was 6. Secondoff, these are much easier to rip to divx and mp3. Third, new songs,remastered originals and other dvd goodies. Its a 2 dvd set so its wellworth the 17$ we paid for it.Even if you dont have kids, run do not walk to pick this one up.Man, I would sure love to have a *nix Rocks for the kids.

         |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|                IT's Monday 520      02 September 2002              |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUXbyJohn SterneThe launch last month of a marketing special interest group by theIrish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, itseems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has alreadysparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  Whenthe new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student willbe offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran atraining class for staff at the UCC computer science department.Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that theLinux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irishuniversities.The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programmethat aims to introduce students at all levels to the open sourcestyle of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educationalchannel' to reach this audience, bundling educational softwarewith its operating environment and offering networked supportservices to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designedto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available toschools and universities throughout the world.Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenancefeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard tomaster on personal systems.The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of RedHat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financialservices for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until nowits involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices inEurope that offer consulting or technical support services.David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to takea more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, hisoffice in Cork has received more and more calls from Irishcompanies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introducedsome to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.-------------Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.RegardsL.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

The material appended below comes from Martin Gardner'sbook _Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science_ -- revisedand expanded edition published in 1957 by Dover Publications,Inc. (New York City).Bill Bennetta_________________________________________________"[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics incommon.        "First and most important of these traits is that cranks workin almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitfulcontacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insiststhat his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,to the prejudice of established scientific groups against newideas. . . .        "The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outsidethe closely integrated channels through which new ideas areintroduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does notsend his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, theyare rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of casesare excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enoughinformed to write a paper with even a surface resemblanceto a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himselfexcluded the journals and societies, and almost universallyignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, thereputable scientist does not even know of the crank'sexistence unless his work is given widespread publicity throughnon-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobbyof collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations hehimself has founded, contributes to journals he himself mayedit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when heor his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printedprivately.        "A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, whichgreatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency towardparanoia. . . .        "There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.        "(1) He considers himself a genius.        "(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, asignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them ofstupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignorehim, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that heis battling scoundrels. . . .        "(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminatedagainst. . . .        "(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on thegreatest scientists and the best established theories.  WhenNewton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric worksin that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, withEinstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory ofphysics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .        "(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complexjargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases hehimself has coined. . . ."-- Terry W.

After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for  nontrivial apps? No way!The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't tryto tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don'tcare --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unixhasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since youwere in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't"totally suck for nontrivial apps".For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* callsfor a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers ofconcurrent I/O requests.

Now that I've pointed out how obviouslyidiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, althoughindividual Unixes do these things well, you complain that theirimplementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threadsspecification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't writtenpthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my ownexperience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason toprefer Windows.I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threadingimplementations.  Spare us.

I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the thechoices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec whichis a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and issomewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sitesrun OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation ofIPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there asignificant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whateveron the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remotesites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexityin software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.Niall-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

I just remember a lunch in Spain witha semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the table, and he managed to insult each of them within15 minutes.

http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=4816872.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resortHolidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizardsunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, onSunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,said: "Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn'thave wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long."Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private ownerbecause it has not been reported missing.Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eatingrats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidenceon 08705 555 999.------------------------ Yahoo!

Its relevance is nil.It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the point of the earlier 3-person example. But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice ofvalues results in meaningful differences between the sexes' "promiscuity", as commonly understood. It should be more obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without sayingso outright, this model actually approximates the cliche "common wisdom" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you reverse the male and female roles.Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiplepartners -- men being "more promiscuous" than women -- and that surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled "sluts").> So I chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post, since this> is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.> > There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested> in typical behaviour and you in extreme. Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement tomake it more defensible. What I objected to was:Robert Harley:# >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous# >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.# # Well, DUH!!!# # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,# precisely identical between males and females.# # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have neededto jump in with a patronizing "DUH!!"? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have huffed and puffed with the words "perfectly obvious" and "exactly, precisely identical"? If your concern was with the "typical", why didn't you adopt the typical definition of "promiscuous", rather than a straw-mandefinition which allowed you to interject "DUH!!" and mock ananthrolopology professor's conclusions? > Actually, you probably just> had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.You are welcome to that theory!But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. "DUH!!... perfectly obvious... exactly, precisely identical..." -- and that pronouncement is itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of popping your balloon. - Gordon

It seems that something changed during the last 3-4 weeks.1) In a folder, msgs 1-n is read, n=current, n upwards is unread.2) change to another folder3) change back to the original folder and you'll see msg n+1 being highlighted as current for a split second, that it changes back to n=current.Kind of annoying since it marks msg n+1 as read./Anders_______________________________________________Exmh-workers mailing listExmh-workers@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)Dear Sir, I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of us. The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was lodged into a security company here in the Country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled aspersonal belongings and as such the security company does not know the true content of the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign. Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund. If you are interested to carry out this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us.You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy communication Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 (seven) working days.I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} _________________________________________________________ Envoyez des messages musicaux sur le portable de vos amis  http://mobile.lycos.fr/mobile/local/sms_musicaux/

I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:Application       What gets pastedXEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmhxterm             same as XEmacsAbiWord           nothingNedit             nothingsedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwrittenThe last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted and typed over (I have "Type Kills SEL" on.).It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??--rick_______________________________________________Exmh-users mailing listExmh-users@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

the latest -http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2240487.stmFriday, 6 September, 2002, 08:53 GMT 09:53 UKZimbabwe eases GM stanceZimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grainso that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, saidZimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries inthe region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distributeground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system ofchecks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrativeexport markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops areGM-free.AidMr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare withZimbabwean President Robert Mugabe."The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable inaccepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to othercountries in the region," Mr Morris told journalists."It will enable us to do our job," he said.Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in SouthernAfrica face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of theregion, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnesof food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government'scampaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers hasworsened the situation, say many donors.Lost marketsThe GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labellingit as 'poison' .Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not beplanted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out thatAmericans eat GM maize every day.The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumptionand says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.------------------------ Yahoo!

Oh thats right Greg.  Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bushfolks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article isthis again?Lets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend tobe sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a fewyears ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may havechanged, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all thepro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn't do enoughof a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.I'll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacablyassemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?Probably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in thisscenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that Ifalsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.End of story.GAB> The problem is that politics have gotten so muddiedGAB> nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disruptingGAB> political rallies that you don't agree with has becomeGAB> common practice.

Muddied my ass.  How hard is it tochose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shoutingdown has grown to become the answer because the government, over aspan of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited therights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If youquestion the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush ingeneral, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs ofthe folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're ananarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' milesaway from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thatsspeech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shoutingover the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any otherway.GAB> I think that given the information as laid out by the story,GAB> Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.

Getting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea toan unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   Howdo you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audiencewithout violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell wasthrowing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't causephysical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking thathas the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who hasthe option to leave.Just my .02, while its still considered legal.-- Best regards, bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net

But gradually, new computer systems came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on Tiburon's experiences in writing and rewriting the memory manager for Madden NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002.
Hi,I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have abase disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That baseimage is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writeschanges to its own "redo" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instanceincorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present thecurrent disk image for that specific virtual machine.This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on thehoneypots mailing list)http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.htmlCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/serverapplications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.The physical architectures of most production client/server systems arelayered. For example, your basic web application might have a web serverrunning Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Netbusiness logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only oneof these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the databaseserver, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on onepartition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only thepartition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change fromone boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swapspace, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image thatshouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS orApache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. Butwhat if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a "delta" or"redo" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased theredo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would beminimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring frombackup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or highavailability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system isalways accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented atthe same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greaterperformance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also beapplied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this conceptbeen discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example inthis post, but this concept could of course be applied to most serversystems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile andnon-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightlyghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (orno) downtime.Thanks for any opinions,Ben

No, you need to learn how declarations work in C.  You have specifiedtestbuff as "an array of 1024 pointers to characters".  That means,you have allocated an array big enough to store 1024 pointers.

I found this interesting, but not very original. Another search engine (can't remember which one tho') was doing this a long time ago.http://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/02Dec2002_biz54.html=====Postcards from Planet GoogleINTERNET: The search engine is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them. So what is the world thinking about?JENNIFER 8. LEEAt Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, transfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the receptionist's desk: animacio{AAC}n japonese Harry Potter pense{AAC}es et poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas.The projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what people around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The terms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, French, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks.The scrolling continues: people who shouldn't marry ``she smoked a cigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto theft fraud how to.Stare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the collective consciousness of the world stream by.Each line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet connection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more than 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer logs millisecond by millisecond.Google is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.So what is the world thinking about?Sex, for one thing.``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking at the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. (To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, though less successfully with foreign languages.)Despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much of its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble to the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what they are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of Google's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and protecting the data record.Google's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has given Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has been able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including milzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell which countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and Germany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are far-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.Judging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost everywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race and the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last year. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music and celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a Google engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney Spears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her popularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.Glancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural literacy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and girlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list recently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose members was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and fentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages taken by Chechen rebels in late October).The long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney Spears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them understand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she broke up with Justin Timberlake.Google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more serious nature, immediately.On Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 am local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to 250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific Northwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and CNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, Nostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that Nostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.But the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive cultural seismic meter.The logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden name'' had surged to the top of the charts.Curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they were neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes after the hour.As the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. Why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not explain them.That is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena per se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a member of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what else is going on in the world.''So what had gone on on April 22, 2001?That night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds after the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to search for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was broadcast successively in each US time zone.The precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some.``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said Sergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford helped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. ``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.''Predictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and radio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. One of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends before they hit the radar of other media.As such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or retailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for commercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is tremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The challenge is defining what we want to do.''Google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data because of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, originating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to a specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly _ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual.In aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next to Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a three-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being used around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots shooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest flames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area.Each country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy have a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely lunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when phone rates for dial-up modems drop.Google's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and phenomena as they hop from country to country.Take Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in Spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking dance similar to the Macarena.Like a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated through Europe over the summer and fall.The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 countries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches began a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands.Haven't heard of Las Ketchup?If you haven't, Google predicts you soon will.===rgrds,Bernard_______________________________________________IIU mailing listIIU@iiu.taint.orghttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu

This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and mh.Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail server to escape lines beginning with "From " if they choose to turn on that facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to rely on "Content-length:" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is unaware of "Content-length:", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the spool.I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:1)  Get your mail administrator to add the "E" flag to your sendmail.  This means you will never see a line beginning with "From ".  Any such line will look like ">From ".2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect "Content-length:".  When I was having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and everything works.-- Jim McMastermailto:mcmasjc@tatanka.stortek.comIn message <200210091657.g99GvDmX025433@life.ai.mit.edu>, Jason Rennie said:> > When I receive a message that has a line starting with "From ", it's> broken into two messages.

http://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtmlDear Garrison,There are at least six plans about what to do with"Ground Zero" in New York. I believe a suitable memorialsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions suchas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art workswould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.What do you think should done with the space?Joe AdamsHillsdale, New JerseyI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattanthat's designed by committee and that's gone throughpublic hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be coldand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one morepublic space that the public hates, of which there areplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial cityand that's the beauty of it, it's a city of youngambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in thetowers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historicevents occurred in New York that in any other city wouldbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides andhistorical museums and in New York there's barely alittle plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking fortheir big chance, and compared to that spirit ofentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and astatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant'sTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about PresidentGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomband think about lunch, about sex, about money, about allthe things that New York is about. If you want to findGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in NewYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorialcity. New York is for the young and lively.
OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIELFEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSINGFEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEXIKOYI-LAGOS.ATTN:,                  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me.

That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very fewreal world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we weretalking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the "capactior is thewrong choice" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steadydischarge curve.But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, notthe 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For thoseyou dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of wholeatoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need witha fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.- Adam L.

Of course it does. You most likely havejust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away whenshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buriedbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-oldsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got whenshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles."My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-oldwoman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than myhusband earns in a year".The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership wherehe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right awayand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little didthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking thanactually finding it in the closet.As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everydayafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on hiscomputer in his bedroom."I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my nameon it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever15-year-old.The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the topand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name tothe top of the list.The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousanddollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with yourname at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, andreally did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Boxthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptionsbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills."About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my boxhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also ayellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought Iwas in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to thecounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride backhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".  Overthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail."  Themoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in thecloset, barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his biketo several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds."I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different bankswith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell thelady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange themoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me areally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for meand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the nextbank down the street (laughs)."  Surprisingly, the boy did not have anyreason to be afraid.The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy wassending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it wascompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also inthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, whichstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,"Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letterlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand howthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before yousay "Bull", please read the following. This is the letter you have beenhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entireshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it reallycan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not theprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and ifpeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make somemegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THISPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTERTHAN EVER.Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time whenI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent sothat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using thefollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept moneyfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad Ifinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimaleffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in themail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructionsand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month Ionly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, Ihave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key tosuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT changeanything." More testimonials later but first,PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to theperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKESURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports fromthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will beaccessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them fromyou. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in casesomething happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed nextto each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what isinstructed below in step "1 through 6" or you will loose out on majority ofyour profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also seehow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has beentested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put theirfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedyand then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other thanwhat is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,honesty reaps the reward!!!1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement andREMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This personhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it onyour computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on adisk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketingyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide youwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulke-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and muchmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we willassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let'salso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the responsecould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 millione-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUTTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOUCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a momentwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those peoplemailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do justthat, and more!METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds ofFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet willeasily get a larger response.We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 asyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them theReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on allorders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your nameand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until theyreceive the report.=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Alwayssend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOTaccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Writethe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++REPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the NetOrder Report #1 from:R.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails untilyou do.+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CANRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash willcontinue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every timeyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Differentreport. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching whichreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATEMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND STARTTHE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income youcan generate from this business!!!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THISPROGRAM: You have just received information that can give youfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST ALITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next fewweeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the programEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It worksexceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put yourname and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 asinstructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customersyou will reach.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am anaccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of thepopulation and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped inwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was onme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.I have joined Jody in her "hobby".Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up mymind to participate in this plan.

Or even 300.Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen'sestimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The averageage of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable tothink that some the participants may have actually slowed their pace a bit. So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one studywill have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distributioncould easily be in the 3000+ range.Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalenceof 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, sopeople should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if itwere sheer fantasy.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516333Date: Not suppliedAll through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival:     Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema     In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been     constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric     permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies     that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers     such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest     avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming     abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce     dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics     are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances     such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the     viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of     machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James     and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary     animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry     Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish     Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns,     while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously     calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton,     and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to     graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no     mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to     try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

Hi everybody!I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database access with postgreSQL).This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications.The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the database, but the database is accessible from the web application. Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the database password, I can use a different database with different user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.Where I can found good documentation about this topic?There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to learn methods and technics.First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the db connection/password to the main web application.In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application (that means, really, another server running in the background).Any suggestions?Thank you,Mario Torre-- Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.See http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html

"Duncan" Beberg  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/  beberg@mithral.com-----------------Tech's Major DeclineCollege Students Turning Away From Bits and BytesBy Ellen McCarthyWashington Post Staff WriterTuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might havesought a stake in the "new" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming anace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imaginedtoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried touse the Internet to end world hunger.But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboringdifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to dosomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, "youcan't get the chicks with that anymore."The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams ofsome fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the techbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments hascome to a halt.The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. Andeducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with somecolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickledinto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association ofComputing Machinery."I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramaticdeclines," said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineeringat Princeton University in January. "It can be hard to see this, because atsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so farexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect."At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer sciencedepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George WashingtonUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computerscience fell by more than half this year.Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in thepast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science andcomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the ComputingResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degreeswere awarded.The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be thefastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with othercomputer-related industries trailing close behind.But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes amongcollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studyinginformation technology and engineering at George Mason University werecomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major isdown to 800, although a newly created and more general informationtechnology major has attracted 200 students."Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief," said Lloyd Griffith,dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school."Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend fouryears on something and then not get a job."Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science majoris expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Marylanddecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone doesnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College ofComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences."We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring theirinterest in pursuing computer science as a major," Halperin said. "That's afactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expectto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are nolonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off."Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is notconvinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on hisadvanced-placement exam in computer science."All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,so I looked for professions in which I could use those things," Yandziaksaid. "I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. Iwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world."Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association ofAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage."There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have thesame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need thiskind of IT training right now,' " Miller said. "Our concern as an industryis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down theroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going tofind themselves in a shortage situation."Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but otherfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and socialinfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professionaldevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perceptionof computer science as an isolating, "nerdy" profession is one that many inthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground duringthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust."All the hipness is gone," Yandziak said. "Once we thought of the Internetas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad thatcame along."Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School inthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study businessmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development."Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,"Thompson said. "To be honest with you, when I think computer science, Ithink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's anecessity, but I wouldn't take it any further."

I've> seen examples of this already, where SA doesn't score the spam high enough> to bounce it, but Razor does.I think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable.  Ifyou want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put thisin your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.  score RAZOR_CHECK 10The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SAthen setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5would be sufficient.If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, oncefor SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razorindividually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SAwon't do it and avoid the double network hit.However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor hasbeen the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  Thecurrent score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wideof use as Razor1.Bob

I was shocked. What about Gettysburg and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal government's main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests.Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because the public and the pressencouraged by the players, who speak in jargoncan't get themselves interested.One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating comedy routine by the commission's chairman.Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the American economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the "corporate scandals" concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes F.C.C. World's feverish mood ("The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns") and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I just quoted is followed by this explanation: "The ILECs appear likely to enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% market share loss in business lines to CLECs." It's a lot easier to think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the head of a federal agencyhe is thirty-nineand genially charming. Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an "avid moderate." And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, calls him "radical and extreme." Just as often as he's accused of being a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious. "It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire," another former chairman, William Kennard, says. "You have to have an answer." One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated him. "You don't care about these regulations," Hollings said. "You don't care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your job?""Extremely," Powell said, with an amiable smile.One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial supervisionits real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful breakup of A.T. & T.by far the biggest and most important company the commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a "natural monopoly," requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more prosperous, too.The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers as "baby Bells" and to F.C.C. World as "arbocks" (the pronounced version of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's slogans about the "information superhighway" and "building a bridge to the twenty-first century," which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like all important interest groups they work with both parties); they immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new companies, "see-lecks" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the see-leckscompanies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligentand into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's former lieutenants told me, "Reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up."The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.)By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than Furchtgott-Roth.Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and gave a very Michael Powell speechwhimsical, intellectual, and free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)that began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new telecom companies alive. "In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas," Powell said. "Like the Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the least, so it is thought." Thus Powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the Bush Administration.Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the poor health of the long-distance companies.The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary of Viacom.In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation, springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle to get new technologyespecially fast Internet connectionsinto the homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions.)But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, when he was asked what he was going to do about the "digital divide"that is, economic inequality in access to the Internethe said, "You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and I can't afford one." At the National Cable & Telecommunications Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault.Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the fact"prophylactically," as he likes to sayshould wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and then became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law school"It's sort of like a law-school study session over there," one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?"I think we'll never know," Powell said. "I don't think it's an automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a similar proposition. There are scholars who argueindeed, the famous Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisthat spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds of ways that we're accustomed to."Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications Act had been excessive."I would start with a caveat," Powell said. "Look, I can't fault those judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it certainly was."But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission, by politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board."Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. " 'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' " Now Powell returned to being Powell. "I think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model."How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? "We could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system," Powell said. "Money chased what seemed like government-promised opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability."Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more "reasonable" level of investment. "No, we wouldn't have every home in America with competitive choice yetbut we don't anyway. I don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so would MCI WorldCom and Sprint."Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable businesses, either, and they never might. "Everybody's always saying, 'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled."Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies stronger? "At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying." Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gesturesin August, for example, five months after disbanding the F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry.I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service. "Yes," he said. "It concerns us that there's one of each of those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other." Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. "So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question is, Does it stay that way?"The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, which distorts markets. "If this were just economics, it's easy. If you were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility that's ascribed to it sometimes."Powell explained, "Sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, and then we have policies like"here his tone went from ironic to sarcastic"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out."F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulatesso he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine."This is why elections matter," Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.much more than, say, the war in Afghanistanis a case in which a Gore Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsthe long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not unrecognizably different from America's past.
My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.I need those houses...Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use "unconventional" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.htmlBritons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in EuropeJohn Carvel, social affairs editorWednesday August 28, 2002The GuardianNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. Accordingto the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook ofanthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at theUniversity of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fitpeople's shape.The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between theinner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease belowthe buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)taller than his French counterpart.The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European menonly the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear heightadvantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), comparedwith 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm andAmericans 1,626.7mmMore disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the othernationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British menand 66.7 for women.The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of1,047.2mm.The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also secondlargest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerablysmaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer thanthe French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than theSwedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massivelyoutstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mmcompared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on theavailable evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mmlonger than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the Americanaverage.The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her Germancounterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute foroccupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed toopen ring pull cans.------------------------ Yahoo!

XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is acompany  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not verygpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users toput preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.Some notes from other places....>>From Doom9 [3]"XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developershave contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for thosewho don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release itunder the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigmacodec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolencode, but the new version of the codec which was released this month onlydisguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was onceagain contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until todaynothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the publicin the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convinceSigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter hasbeen resolved XviD development will not continue.That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads aboutthe Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authorsfirst wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishesand kept quiet about the matter at hand.[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability ofthe source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press releasemakes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so wemight be hearing more about this.[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but italso looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviDdoesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collideswith Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign beforedownloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'dfully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship withSigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivXcompatible as it was advertised.[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigmasource code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. Thelicense agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, andinstall the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can nowclearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all thecopyright notices of the original developers have been removed andreplaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - youcan't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyrightstatements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote onyour own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code takenfrom the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 differentcopyright notices which is quite funny."[1] http://www.xvid.org/[2] http://www.sigmadesigns.com[3] http://www.doom9.org/http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the "cash" is not because this isillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :==================================================REPORT # 1: "The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net"Order Report #1 from:Robert Borowczykul.

My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================"Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big."Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada================================================="I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks."Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================="It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you.

I've added a flag "kernsrc", that also can be used--without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  Itwould be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist(/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'ma beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a filenot provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no wayto do that.I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cardsoption in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only foundout about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs don't help much.Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version ofalsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supplythe dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modulesfrom source.  It created the /dev files and all.Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuildthe alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec:rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp--without kernsrcBut I get this:==[long successful compile snipped]=====================================warning: File listed twice: /dev/adspwarning: File listed twice: /dev/amidiFinding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-providesFinding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requiresPreReq: /bin/sh /bin/sh rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1Requires(interp): /bin/sh /bin/shRequires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1Requires(post): /bin/shRequires(postun): /bin/shRequires: alsa-kernel = 0.9.0rc3 /sbin/depmodProcessing files: alsa-kernel-0.9.0rc3-fr4_2.4.19Finding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-providesFinding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requiresPreReq: rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1Requires: alsa-driver = 0.9.0rc3 kernel = 2.4.19Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files/var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-rooterror: Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:     /etc/makedev.d/00macros     /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasoundRPM build errors:      File listed twice: /dev/adsp      File listed twice: /dev/amidi      Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:     /etc/makedev.d/00macros     /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound========================================================================Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understandmuch of what's going on here.

This > would probably be by a malformed or extremely long string in the key > value, which would presumably lead to either DOS or system compromise by > buffer overflow on the client system.And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide open for something nasty here.Two other things spring to mind; 1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell me where I might have misunderstood.Med venlig hilsen / Best regards,-Allan JensenSi hoc signum legere potes, operis boni in rebus Latinus alacribus et fructuosis potiri potes!

Jets Attempt to Intercept 'Contrail' By ROBERT BURNSAP Military Writer WASHINGTON (AP)--The military command responsible for the defense of NorthAmerican airspace scrambled fighter jets in response to unverified reportsof an airborne condensation trail, or contrail, moving from the Caribbean tothe United States, defense officials said Thursday. Lt. Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happenedWednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in ColoradoSprings, Colo., was continuing to investigate. The reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that itcould have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in orapproaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, thePentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. A contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of coldair. The jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the sourceof the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORADspokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initialreport at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its trackingradars in search of evidence, he said. A Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``whatappeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,'' originally in the vicinity ofthe Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. ``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the UnitedStates,'' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported thecontrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightingswere reported.'' The reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, thePentagon statement said. At the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I'maware of the reports.'' He referred all questions to NORAD. Jenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over theCaribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets orfrom which military bases they were scrambled. ``We don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us toinvestigate'' a contrail, he said. Meanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursdayhad people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stationswith calls reporting a meteor shower. It was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-enteringthe Earth's atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,Neb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russianrocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details.

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other "promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message.

Some of this has todo with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When Iwas last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reportingsomething like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and overseveral distinct issues.The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhousethat is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, theirinterests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government inOttawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars toOttawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have tokenrepresentation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear onexactly how the government works up there, representation is notentirely based on population, and it works out that some easternprovinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone havesubstantially more representatives in the legislature than the entireprovince of Alberta.  The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Albertaas a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even somuch as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even thesparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite havingfewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is lessrestricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, likehaving restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It isessentially a much worse version of what is happening in theinter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest ofCanada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those taxdollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totallyclear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partialunfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a littlefuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average theAlbertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada andthe sentiment has been getting worse over the years.Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and     instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope     to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to     a study released on Wednesday from KPMG...

If we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole lot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms are huge, at least for us n^1 world courties ... ;-{ ...	I will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working idea ...Thanks guys.MailedLee_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem we have at my house:We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the lines of "Huh?" or "I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please." And eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the account representatives and billing people and their managers and their managers' managers ad naseum.The outcome of every phone call is that they'll "look into it" and fix the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked "Not at this address, please fsck off." and then eventually call them back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which they seem all too happy to do.At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.Perplexed,Eliasbitbitch@magnesium.net wrote:>>So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they're called now).>Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing>and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33.>>[...]>

Staring intohis empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on anunlikely solution: Put a tax--just a "benign" dime a shot--onespresso.That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, onethat taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 poundof beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattlealso has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle'sBest Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for thetax. "For people outside of Seattle who don't understand theconsumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,"said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, "but it wascommon sense."Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed thatpeople preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. Butbecause of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax onespresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million ayear. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their researchshows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. Thethink tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests oflow-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programsmade earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it wouldprovide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables ofcustomers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend anextra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. "I'm OK withit," said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. "The money's gotto come from somewhere."Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because shebrought her own mug) and reading "Zen and the Art of Pottery." Shesupports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would beexpected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing onthe menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos aday, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. "I, forone, don't have kids, but I drink espresso," he said, as he sewed aleather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. "I don't mind paying, but Ithink everyone should pay."Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized asJOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle'sChamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,Starbucks and Tully's.The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage thatcontains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmarefor smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. Ifespresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face acity audit.University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. "The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this isneither," he said. "On the efficiency side, it's surely going to leadto costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways toavoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are usingfinely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they beright? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legalfees that could have gone to child care."Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingeniousidea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espressodrinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side withthe espresso drinkers?"In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a politicaltwo-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their publicstance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,corporations continually advertise their commitment to socialactivism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT membersprefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care."Starbucks will continue to support early-learning andchildhood-development programs through the millions of dollars wecontribute annually," the company said. "However, Starbucks does notunderstand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend anadditional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other singleconsumer product."The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go beforevoters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed atvendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers throughhigher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce ofespresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group ofconsumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's beenpitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dimeevery time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, findsfunny. "I drink espresso," she said, laughing, "and I am not rich."JH> "I did not have sex with that woman.">> -----Original Message----->> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf OfJH> Mr.>> FoRK>> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:12 PM>> To: FoRK>> Subject: Re: Goodbye Global Warming>> >> >> ----- Original Message ----->> From: "John Hall" <johnhall@evergo.net>>> >> > A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they>> > would have had to invent it.>> A Republican once said "I am not a crook".-- Best regards, bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net

Ifyou're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currentlydo).Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?garyP.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages!

I say half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs. "0 Control Panel[3]", "1 Mozilla[4]", "2 Emacs[5]", "3 DOS home", "4 DOS work", "5 DOS incoming" (each of which gives me a command line, but in different directories), "7 Python[6]", "9 IE". Also "# Explorer home", "$ Explorer work", "% Explorer incoming", which open Explorer windows in various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed. "Ad-aware[7]", "Excel[8]", "IM", "Netscape 4[9]", "Paint Shop Pro", "Query Tool (ODBC)[10]", "VMWare[11]", "Word[12]". All other submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete "Accessories". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them (mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the window. In Mozilla, I set my home page to "about:blank", set Internet Search to search with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept "y" and "n" for yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My _emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is my single most backed-up possession. Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].[1]  http://bitworking.org/Oct2002.html#X631695997519494480[2]  http://www.winterspeak.com/columns/082001.html[3]  http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article02-013[4]  http://www.mozilla.org/[5]  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html[6]  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/[7]  http://www.lavasoftusa.com/[8]  http://www.openoffice.org/[9]  http://sillydog.org/narchive/[10] http://gpoulose.home.att.net/[11] http://www.vmware.com/[12] http://www.openoffice.org/[13] http://www.cygwin.com/[14] http://diveintomark.org/mt/mt-search.cgi[15] http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/index.html#notepad     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32[16] http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp[17] http://www.cygwin.com/[18] http://www.guidescope.com/[19] http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10039884.html?part=zonealarm&subj=dlpage

The Times  December 04, 2002   University boom creates era of sexual tolerance By Helen Rumbelow    THE boom in university education has led to a sea change in Britains tolerance of homosexuality, according to a report. Just under half the people now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three quarters 15 years ago, according to the British Social Attitudes survey, regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion.   That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities, with 75 per cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced, compared with 60 per cent in 1987.   Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, decided to focus on what has caused Britain to become more open-minded in a report published today. The study, from the National Centre for Social Research, is based on interviews with a cross-section of 3,500 people.   Young people are much more tolerant than their elders, with a quarter of twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong, compared with two thirds of pensioners.   But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college, with graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs, and a third less racist.   That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from and, with 41 per cent of young people now attending university, it was a powerful social effect, Professor Evans said.   Mr Blairs famous mantra education, education, education seems far less consequential now than when first announced in 1997, as Britain struggles with an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people get degrees, degrees buy less and less, he said.   But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance, he added.   He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would give to an unattractive minority: white supremacists.   Again, people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and university, with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections, three times as many as those with no qualifications.   It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant, the report says, adding that it may be simply because university students have increased contact with alternative points of view.   Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their idealism, but found the opposite to be true.   Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties. He said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older generation, Britain would become an ever more relaxed place.   Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability, with more than half the country wanting cannabis to be legalised, compared with a third seven years ago. That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread, with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it.   A third of Labour voters, twice as many as Conservatives, had tried the drug, and being young, living in London and having a degree also increased the chances.   One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs. Most take a strong position on heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years. Now the proportion of people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept up to 97 per cent.   The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal free-for-all, Alison Park, co-director of the study, said. People are making quite a clear distinction between what they think (of) as right and wrong.   On other matters, the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits  in fact, they account for 6 per cent; that union membership has fallen by a fifth in the past 18 years, with just under a third of workers in a union; and that half those questioned oppose secondary school selection. In 1984 the figure was 40 per cent.   The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live with their parents, twice as many as women.

I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports allPython platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikelyto offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, evenL|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added totheir MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, aclient-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm onlygoing to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhamsthe incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). TheMUA accesses this "eThunk" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam isretained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manualoversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUAfetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am notclear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully allMUAs can split the host fetch/send URL'sIMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. Ifthis is available, the "simple viewer" could be enhanced to support viewingvia folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I woulduse this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the bestn-way classifier uses something called a "Support Vector Machine" (SVM)which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leavesthe fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it couldbe dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.David LeBlancSeattle, WA USA

First, misattribution.  I did not write the blurb below.  I made onestatement about VP Cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.I couldn't agree with you more on this: "in short, then, economics is not azero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backsof the poor, and redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshitis just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise," however, I resent being lumpedin a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich andsuccessful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning tounderstand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my adhominem (re Cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like "if rich thendeservedly" or "if rich then smarter."  Given that, I am also beginning tounderstand why some people NEED to be rich.WRT to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies!  WRT Harvard: over 90% of2002 graduates were cum laude +.

Can you say"Bootstraps", boys and girls? I knew you could...[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taughtyou in a government-run "high" school, you'll probably get more of*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever getaround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsingtransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer'sgovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind ofinnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west thissummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers outthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a"terminal" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from thebest school possible.Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over theyears for proof.Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League afterWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* whogoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actuallyafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, whocouldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in thelast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,and "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal"degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, orlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and lossbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life afterdeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb peoplewho don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of thisrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it tobeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. Youwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went toMissouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,much less a "terminal" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone onthis list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots witheducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. Thefacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, andeconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, includingignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,intelligence and effort.[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level ofcompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,apparently.]BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, andthere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practicallyall of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency andnot "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.That efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in ThePeople's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and betterstuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois conceptapparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'dknow about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increasein general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking aboutextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone whodoesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of somepolitician as Santa Claus come election time...In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is nottheft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, andredistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is justthat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marxwrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.Cheers,RAH-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPY511cPxH8jf3ohaEQLAsgCfZhsQMSvUy6GqJ5wgL52DwZKpIhMAnRuRYYboc+IcylP5TlKL58jpwEfu=z877-----END PGP SIGNATURE------------------------R.

INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. Research Alert - UndervaluedAugust 26, 2002XrayMedia(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!How does the company do this? XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a "mass source to advertising sector " live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. Their "source to business model", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon. *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings "substantially" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired articlethat goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love andrespect for its users.http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.htmlThere is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over athttp://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html"True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gaina competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface intheir applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverseengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popularthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (thirdparty or otherwise) was in development.All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because theprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would haveupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they haveresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the firstplace.But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forciblyexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of"known" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, itis not allowed to load.It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants"developers, developers, developers!", but Microsoft clearly understandssomething that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platformvendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. InApple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards tomake every single system service and UI element "pluggable" via publicAPIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be thenumber one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, ifthird party developers want to sell into a market that requires thedesired functionality to be added in "unsupported" ways, then they must beprepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developereffort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing toprovide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish.

They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltageregulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughlythe energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kineticenergy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- ina vacuum.Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much doesthe 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I betit isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially storedelectrically in the capacitor.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221Date: Not suppliedThe Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable:     By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to     third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers,     consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently     this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the     initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief     Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA     members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared     information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but     supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared     his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the     hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for "Hell Freezes     Over," which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no     more than a 10% "reserve" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had     held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years)     and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they     had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

It ispart of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably moreserious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountainWest.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptableprotest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, ifheated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of thelocal population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protestsI've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actuallyfacing immediate dire consequences from the activities they areprotesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that getsresults.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businessesand restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone knownto be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been veryeffective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing theirprotests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

In pratice that would probably work fine.Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIMEsections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could putmegabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough toskip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIMEsections).Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers puttingarbitrary amounts of "nice text" in the preamble area (after the headers andbefore the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, butwhich appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoringscheme.But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that theyexist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that noparticular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage forspammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kindof scheme we're using here they can't *know* what "nice text" is, not unlessthey pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor theirmessages to each different one.

One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitiousrendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fictionis more "real" than the reality.  You see it over and over again inhistory:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The JuniorAnthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only becameJunior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before youknow it the charade takes on a life of its own which the PrimitivePeople are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there issubstantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, thefacts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fictionthat is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. AmericanIndians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the mythin popular culture.I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter whereyou are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when youhave a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normalpopulation, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate.

Youdraw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Takeabout 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefullylistening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurtsand where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes ofthis the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is toimagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."Works!

Alhaji Gwarzo was the chiefsecurity advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in theperson of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With theadvent of a new democraticdispensation in the country under the leadership ofGen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come undersevere persecution due to the sensitive position heheld in the last military regime, presently he isunder house arrest restricted only to the confines ofhis village.The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of abusiness proposal that might be of interest to you. Myclient has informed me of the existence of fundsdeposited with a security company abroad. This fundcame about as part of security votes that wereallocated to my client's portfolio during his tenureas chief security adviser to the then president. Whathappened was that he had part of the funds transferredfrom the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to thissecurity outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personalsecurity outfit of thethen president. But before the purchase could takeplace the president died. My client has decided tokeep this for himself as all his properties has beenconfisticated by the present regime. But due to hisincarceration he cannot travel out and effect thechange of possession to his benefit.I have been mandated by my client to source for aforeign partner that can help him facilitate thechange of possession. The deposit certificate and thecode needed for the execution of this endeavor are inmy possession.The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred ThousandUnited States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.I remain most obliged.Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).Principal Partner.

It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is"NEVER".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.

The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income.

The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.

Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness.

(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the pro-CSS camp[1]. So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like &#8220;you should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile devices&#8221;? Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,806744,00.htmlEvangelicals' threat to new archbishopDirect action threat over liberal views on sexualityStephen Bates, religious affairs correspondentTuesday October 8, 2002The GuardianEvangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oustRowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takesup his post, by threatening to take "direct action" against him.The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldestevangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant hissupposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders metthe archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to hisappointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt todestabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regardedwith deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he hasordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those whohave sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The newarchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of thechurch.Nevertheless, the society said: "It is clear that he prefers his privatejudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to thecommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity."The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that RowanWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or standdown," it said.The society claimed to have drawn up an "action plan," including calling onbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, ofwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves fromDr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be"taking steps towards appropriate direct action".It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journalcalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articlesallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of thechurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crownappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and hisappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will beformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, thesociety's chairman, said: "Watch this space." Presumably it could involve asmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seekingalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williamsis present.Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads downduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to theevangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in theabsence of a robust rebuttal.A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates theevangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblicalteaching.On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal ofWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumptionand blackmail. "It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It isattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to getyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation," she said.Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. "Matters of sexualityshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the ChurchSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw hisappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to takethe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God."------------------------ Yahoo!

Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.B) "How it is currently being expressed" amounts to a tacit acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of society.C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also aren't 'found in the wild'.(By "primitive expression", I don't mean to slight any society, but that there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.).  The US has only really been mostly free of "primitive expression" for 40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage of British conquest, but who doesn't?)(I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=truehttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united IrelandThe provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern Ireland understatement, as "The Troubles."'>2.

I'd be happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there.>3.

It doesn't look too hard.Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan packagedid.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before Iknew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from<http://woozle.org/~neale/src/spamcan/spamcan.html>, but I'm not goingto work on it anymore.I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest'sbooty-kicking tokenizer).  I'll probably have something soon, like maybehalf an hour, and no, it's not too hard.  The hard part is storing thedata somewhere.  I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something aperson can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm islooking like my best option.I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, whichdoes the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a newheader, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:  train-eggs  train-spam  trained-eggs  trained-spamYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the "train-" boxes as you get it.How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get betterresults if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy overanything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairyswoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts ofthings you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she'sdone, she moves your mail into the "trained-" folders.This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who readtheir mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at workabout Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exportsappropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mailclient to bind the key "S" to "move to train-spam" and "H" to "move totrain-eggs".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'dstart showing up in mail clients.  That's the "delete as spam" buttonPaul Graham was talking about.* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word "ham" as the  opposite of "spam", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as  "eggs".Neale

Anyone have hints on this issue ?What do you mean by "CD-Key or the like" (I presume that "of" was atypo)? And what do you mean by "unbreakable"?You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish tosolve, and about the constraints involved.Some general points:1. For a conventional "CD key" system, where the actual CDs aremass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entiresystem has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keysbeing "traded" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of theproduct).If there's an online element involved, you can "tie" keys to aspecific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's"product activation".2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to bevulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines withinthe executable.3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to"cracking", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent thevalidation checks.This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. aPalladium-style system).Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is onlyaccessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in ameaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful partsand discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).IOW, you have to "keep the genie in the bottle" at all times. If thedata can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicatedhardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated anddistributed without limit.-- Glynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>

Amassed during the initial stages of a complicatedinsurance lawsuit involving the trade center, theconfidential material contains data and expert analysisdeveloped by some of the nation's most respectedengineering minds. It includes computer calculations thathave produced a series of three-dimensional images of thecrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,helping to identify the sequence of failures that led tothe collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of thedebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also beenaccumulated in a collection that far outstrips whatgovernment analysts have been able to put together as theystruggle to answer the scientifically complex andemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadlyfailures of the buildings. But everyone from structural engineers to relatives ofvictims fear that the closely held information, whichincludes the analysis and the possible answers thatfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, mayremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, theexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as theywait for the case to play out. Such restrictions aretypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as itnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed thatcertain material can remain secret for the time being - hasapproved standard legal arrangements that, should thelawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucialmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. "We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, butwe can't until we're told what to do," said Matthys Levy,an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,who is a consultant in the case and the author of "WhyBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail" (Norton, 2ndedition, 2002). "Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the wholeprocess" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when thesouth tower fell and who is a member of the SkyscraperSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed."If they have answers and are not going to share them, Iwould be devastated," Mrs. Gabrielle said. "They have amoral obligation." The lawsuit that has generated the information involvesLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on thetrade center property, and a consortium of insurancecompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetlinerthat hit the towers constituted a separate terroristattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than halfthat amount, as the insurance companies say. As both sides have prepared their arguments, they havespent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expertopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers ofHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, saidof the findings, "There are some confidentiality agreementsthat are keeping those out of the public domain today." Heconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20insurers on his side of the case could complicate anyrelease of the material. As for his own company, whose consultants alone haveproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands ofdiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attemptwould be made to give the material eventually to "publicauthorities and investigative teams." Still, some of that analysis relies on information likeblueprints and building records from other sources, likethe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which builtand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein inthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how thediffering origins of the material would influence hiscompany's ability to release information. In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documentswould be "decided on a case-by-case basis consistent withapplicable law and policy," adding that it would cooperatewith "federal investigations." The fate of the research is particularly critical toresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry intothe buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by theFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by fewresources, a lack of access to crucial information likebuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.A new federal investigation intended to remedy thosefailings has just begun at the National Institute ofStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that hasstudied many building disasters. Officials with NIST have said it could take years to makefinal determinations and recommendations for otherbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speededup with access to the analysis done by the consultants onthe lawsuit. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said ofthe real estate executive's own heavily financedinvestigative work, "We decline to comment other than tosay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NISTinvestigation." A spokesman for the agency confirmed it wasin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, butsaid no transfer had taken place. With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations byboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling bodyof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to thetrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. "The work should be available to other investigators," saidRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partnerat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlierinquiry. "It could be used to build better buildings in thefuture." Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the onegoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,from full or partial disclosure to destruction of suchinformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for thereports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask tohave them sealed forever. "It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keepsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,some legitimate, some not," said Lee Levine, a FirstAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of theinformation, the court might look favorably on requests tomake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of thematerial is unnerving to many people, especially expertswho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protecttheir own interests - could lead to an advance in thefederal investigation of the trade center. "It's important for this to get presented and published andsubjected to some scrutiny," said Dr. John Osteraas,director of civil engineering practice at Exponent FailureAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on thecase, "because then the general engineering community cansort it out." The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast byany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at WeidlingerAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have calledupon powerful computer programs, originally developed withthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model ofthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images ofthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damagedcore of the towers, beginning with the impacts andproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helpedpinpoint the structural failures. The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computermodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access tothe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeksimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraintshampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought tothe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon ofSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and aconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said hehad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at groundzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about howthe towers fell. Though the FEMA team could not determine "where thingsactually fell," Mr. Cuoco said, "we've indicated thespecific locations." Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional detailsof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the detailsof computer calculations his company has done on the spreadof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive ofphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some ofwhich he believes have not been available to otherinvestigators. And the investigation has not limited itself to computersand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in windtunnels in the United States and Canada have been examiningthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressedthe weakening structures. Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in FortCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies buthad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for theoriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. Forthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, "we've done probably moredetailed measurements than in the original design." "The data that have been acquired are very valuable inthemselves for understanding how wind and buildingsinteract," Dr. Cermak said. "Some of the information may bevaluable for the litigation," he said, adding, "I thinkI've told you all I can."http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1HOW TO ADVERTISE---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contactonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.htmlLioness adopts fifth antelopeRory Carroll, Africa correspondentTuesday October 8, 2002The GuardianKamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adoptingher fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffledwildlife experts.The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted herlatest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.Each time Kamuniak, whose name means "the blessed one" in the local Samburutongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowedthe natural mothers to feed them.Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion whileKamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved bytheir natural mothers.The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari ("taken byforce"), was adopted at the weekend."She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony," saidGabriel Lepariyo, a warden.Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at adistance.Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniakis lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves arecubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviourand confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wantsto be loved. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of todays most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization.Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the basis for todays most popular architectural style for developing network applications: client-server interaction using request-response communication protocols.I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.

URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.htmlDate: Not suppliedDaniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: "Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's a Mac application a net plus? (No.)" Well _duh_. Your product would have to appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money. Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that magic 25 multiplier.[1] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/09/10[2] http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0207/03.marketshare.php[3] http://websidestory.com/cgi-bin/wss.cgi?corporate&news&press_1_193[4] http://radio.weblogs.com/0001123/2002/04/10.html

This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a generaldealing-with-SPAM issue.What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAILFROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I thinkmost people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a "permanent" error. Thatpretty much means, "Don't bother to try from that address again,you'll get the same error." People often add cathartic messages toaccompany the 550 like, "Spammers must die."But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammersthat you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods toget around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, butthen just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally howSpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTPtransaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything isgoing fine and has no reason to try new methods.Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 codeindicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which issaying "mailbox does not exist." This would be in the hopes that somespammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent fromtheir lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it canlower the incidence.So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ ofthe bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must behuge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way togo... But sending back that "Spammer die, die, die," or stock "AccessDEE-NIED!" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)-- Crist J.

However, if in additionhave to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to lookmuch less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setupthe whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the deleteaction, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problemswith this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep aroundwithout deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force ofhabit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted onein the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this weneed a way to compare two word count histograms, to seehow similar they are.  Any ideas ?Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),false positives become the senders problem, to rewriteto remove the spam smell.In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be muchsmaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to beslightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam fromthe ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages fromthe spam corpus, in case of user ooops.	/Paul

So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and thismeans she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and gettingthe music playing.By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI designfrom watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a marketniche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, butdoesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, insteadrequiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UIdisaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses thebutton again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only everget music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens asurprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button againwhen the music doesn't play.For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press thebutton multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn'tchange the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times youpress, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to bethe same.The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UIdisaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angleCDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of aproblem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces andwiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (butwhich hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, ithasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems tounderstand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides theCD.Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this isa mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put theplayer into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressingthe play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono andFM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands thebinary distinction of music/no music.What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately startplaying a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, itwould give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least halfthe size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, sothere is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color ofthe player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. Thedevice would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flipopen at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. Itshould be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'without affecting the player.- Jim

I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot ofwhat I would call bloat:  >>> import anydbm, hammie  >>> d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes("ham.db")  >>> db = anydbm.open("ham.db")  >>> db["neale"], len(db["neale"])  ('ccopy_reg\n_reconstructor\nq\x01(cclassifier\nWordInfo\nq\x02c__builtin__\nobject\nq\x03NtRq\x04(GA\xce\xbc{\xfd\x94\xbboK\x00K\x00K\x00G?\xe0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00tb.', 106)  >>> d.wordinfo["neale"], len(`d.wordinfo["neale"]`)  (WordInfo'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)', 42)Ignoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickledversion of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the stringrepresentation.  So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by usingthe string representation instead of the pickle, right?Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what itis.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but everyvalue of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's aton of redundancy.  I guess that explains why it compressed so well.Neale

Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which isalready pretty tricky > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them tocheck their date stamp, you could just read them again.

Is there a way to do a global Sort command? Here's the situation: I like to sort by date every folder. I'm cleaning up my inbox from most recent to oldest, since I find this direction most efficient (I guess because it helps me recognize the significance of individual, old messages). But this adds messages to my other folders in the wrong order. When I'm done, I'd like to re-sort all the folders I've changed.--rick_______________________________________________Exmh-users mailing listExmh-users@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

[Skip Montanaro]> Any thought to wrapping up your spam and ham test sets for> inclusion w/ the spambayes project?I gave it all the thought it deserved <wink>.  It would be wonderful to getseveral people cranking on the same test data, and I'm all in favor of that.OTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has more than 35,000 files slobbering over134 million bytes -- even if I had a place to put that much stuff, I'm notsure my ISP would let me email it in one msg <wink>.Apart from that, there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was thatthis isn't the data I hoped I was using.  I *hoped* I was using a snapshotof only recent msgs (to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 2002),but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium.  Greg Ward iscurrently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get amore modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.  But if that stream containsany private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available.Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from apublic mailing list?  Everyone's eager to share their spam, but spam is somuch alike in so many ways that's the easy half of the data collectionproblem.
    Date:        Wed, 21 Aug 2002 10:40:39 -0500    From:        Chris Garrigues <cwg-dated-1030376441.95dd45@DeepEddy.Com>    Message-ID:  <1029944441.398.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>  | The background color in this window is the same as the background   | color in the ftoc.That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn'tconstant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different backgroundthan others.In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),it doesn't need a different background as well.I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead ofhorizontal, and see what turns up.  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.OK.  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how itdisplays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an"all unknown" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which hasno defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treatedspecially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring asa dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)  | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?  |   | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changingrelief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just abit too similar.   I ended up using*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was usinghad spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa whichis probably safer for generic use.kre_______________________________________________Exmh-workers mailing listExmh-workers@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers
URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85378428Date: Not suppliedI received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let your kids watch it.The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.[1] http://www.parentstv.org/

I propose they rename it "Charlie Heston High" and maybe the students  will learn to take AR-15s with extended military-spec scopes and .223  high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in  the suburbs of Washington.  That's far more effectual than blowing  oneself up in a bus.In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political  doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant.  But random violence  is entertainment and intrigue.A couple of ex-FBI "consultants" speaking on the shootings in DC were  quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a  "heroin-like high" from each successful kill and that they "for  whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose  at law enforcement and society."See?  Just a couple of kids having fun with Daddy's semi-automatic  hunting rifle.  Harmless!-Ian.

HELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, youwill see how you can learn new skills in communication,do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at thesame time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you toCHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!************SUMMARY***************************Just read this Summary, follow the actions that it advises,and start earning some serious money.  You will learn newskills in communications and how to market on the internet.What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,and you have not joined in this program before, thentake out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mailout $10.00 each to the following people to purchase fiveGuides on communications.  For each Guide that you willbe ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain whitepaper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAILADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide thatyou are buying.  Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 billinside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 billinto an envelope, address the envelope with the name andaddress of the person whose name is shown under eachGuide below, and mail the envelope by first class or airmail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on theenvelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.LIST OF FIVE NAMES****************************________________________________________________GUIDE# 1: "How to be A More Effective Public Speaker"Order Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition toGuide #1, you will receive a valuable marketing Guide"A Million Bucks From the Internet", free of charge)Derrick Nguyen	9530 Whitmore St	El Monte, CA 91733	USA________________________________________________GUIDE # 2: "How to Give a Business Presentation"Order Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from:Tim FaiGPO Box 260Macau (via Hong Kong)________________________________________________GUIDE# 3: "How to Write More Effectively"Order Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from:Luis PastorApartado 8148080 BilbaoSpain________________________________________________GUIDE # 4: "What to do at a Social Function"Order Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from:Chester Waldvogel11 Chestnut WayBerlin, MD 21811USA________________________________________________GUIDE # 5: "How To Sharpen Your Mind"Order Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from:J. SidenKrondikesvagen 54 A83147 OstersundSweden________________________________________________END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save theseGuides on your computer's hard disk as other people will beordering these Guides from you, paying you for them andyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name andaddress of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace thatslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4'sslot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, andreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, andreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, andreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, andreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. Thisstep is how your own name and address is entered into thelist of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,your own name will go down the list of names until you havereached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. Thekey point is that the number of people ordering Guides fromyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send outthis new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) toas many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailingsyou make, potentially the greater the number of people whowill order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will thenmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the emailshowing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest ofthis email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 stepsshown above. Remember, the key point is to send out asmany emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and helpthose who purchase the Guides from you to send outemails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediatereaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the listwith the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.That might seem to you like a clever move because newbuyers will be sending their money to these people.  Butthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.What will benefit you most is having people who will sendout emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to newbuyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going tobe sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself byeffectively closing down the program with your name ontop of the list of the names that you have inserted.  Therewouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuverwill gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have donethe work, and your name has worked its way to furtherdown the list, by then you deserve the rewards andearnings from that effort, and it would be unethical foranyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don'tdo it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 tothe five people on the list that one of the people will justtake your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, restassured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have youas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to findnew buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try tocheat you or to "stiff" you for $10.00.  The people on the listwould rather have you working hard because your effort willbenefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers sendyou the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the dealby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success inthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinarypeople who may not have done any internet marketing before.And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether aRECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you canafford to buy that new car or home that you have beenlooking for.

Treat it as suchand you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable periodof time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself andthe others on the list of five.===========================================*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHERCHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and thatyou and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much betterbut let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people willsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded alsosend out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out ofthose 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 ordersfor Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails eachfor a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% responseis 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a totalof 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  Thismay seem a small amount to you, but remember we used avery low response rate with a small number of emails beingsent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rateup just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyoneor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000emails each or more?  From the example above, you can seethe power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is theamount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwideand counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there areMany FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads onthe internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you startwith  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email theGuide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and adviseyou how to get the large number of email addresses thatyou need to send the new email containing your name andaddress.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides totheir email addresses.  This will benefit you because yourname would be further down the list, and their new buyerswill buy from you.  This is no different than "customerservice" in the retail or the  "bricks and mortars" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============The reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal orsomehow  "wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checksor credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing itis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelopeand steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for eachGuide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hiddenby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one ofthose sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAMEof the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESSand your name and postal address.  Be sure to address theenvelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps tomail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOWFROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWNAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL________________________________________________YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. Ifnot, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, andcash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANTTO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with adviceand instruction on how to send out more emails. You canKEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides peopleare ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATEMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILSAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!===========================================A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:You have just received information that can give youfinancial freedom to really change your life, but I don'twish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT.

Ananova:  Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer bykeeping herds of insects.The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food andbuilding materials.The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from aspecies called cryptostigma.Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the beesstop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the beesscrape off and use for their nest.Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered inbees.Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: "Inturn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection."Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carrytheir insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning furtherresearch on how they tend to their herd.Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugarfrom the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.Story filed: 13:49 Wednesday 28th August 2002------------------------ Yahoo!

Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity ofthis continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Evenfor descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendentsof slaves, who were brought here by force.More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity inwealth has nothing to do with it.It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, onlyindividuals do. Like group rights, "disparity" in wealth isstatistical sophistry.Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealthis almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even whenthere are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still theresince 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes onwealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,they're nowhere near the top.I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislatedmonopoly, corporate welfare, "non-profit" neoaristocratic tax dodges,and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, likewhat happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most "unfairly"distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, morepeople living longer.I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when thereturns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.Cheers,RAH-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPYy3ysPxH8jf3ohaEQLqNQCg14YvF8NVYwKiRrghHdisBoNCOn8AoPcRQUzorXeaLe5h3T1syKl7DFNT=9kff-----END PGP SIGNATURE------- -----------------R.

The Times September 06, 2002  Scissors are a snip for Third World From Richard Owen in Rome    IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from passengers hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the X-ray scanners.   Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.   He told Corriere della Sera that he had plucked up the courage to ask the authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre.   Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique, Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. In such countries, what we think of as a personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.   The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports.   ------------------------ Yahoo!

Unfortunately, these countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users." Offshore usability is a specific case of the general "offshore design" problem. Put simply, software teams are not successful when design or management are done in a different physical location than programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 development every day. What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.[1] http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020916.html

And the bandwidth shadows in most citiesare surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, whichis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize nextgeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a largescale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wirelessconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots andothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transitconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimizethe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wirelessis tied into fiber at multiple points.The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, buta mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidthmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up towell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges andbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by anorder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows andproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize thecost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providerscan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly lowbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level oflarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effectivebandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company'slong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary tokeep things sane.Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into thesystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is moreefficient).-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

Maybe we can lower FPs a bit more.  :-)I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't factored in to the GA scores.The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as time goes on.The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 2.41 or 2.50 branches.DQ> Something like:DQ> DQ>   for (low = -12; low <= -4; low += 2)DQ>     for (high = 2; high <= 6; high += 2)DQ>       evolveYou could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and liable to be forged to generate FNs.DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.DQ> > AFAIK there's nothing major hanging out waiting to be checked in DQ> > on b2_4_0 is there?DQ> DQ> Nope.Great!DQ> > I'll be on IM most of today, tomorrow, and monday while cranking DQ> > on the next Deersoft product release (should be a fun one).

the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in theuniverse. too big to decrypt.my point is there will never be a "safe" key. what I would consider is howlong does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data forlonger than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying tostop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use whatis available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do notrelease the data to the public.I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlockingthe key gives away it's secret.the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XPfor example. only the home user is forced to register. think of thenightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have weneeded to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after theXP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on mycomputer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make mereturn them and get my money back.the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.jef

If they are, my guess is that Habeus will probably notsucceed.Taking things further off-topic: Does Habeus charge a license fee toorganizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their solerevenue stream to come from legal judgements?  On the one hand, if theycharge license fees, I'd worry that when times got tough they'd be somewhatless critical of organizations we'd call spammers today in order to generatelicense fees.  If not, I'd worry the pendulum would swing the other way andthey'd go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate morerevenues from judgements and/or out of court settlements.

I've been testing Razor, invoked from sendmail/procmail and so far itseems pretty copacetic. Last night's spam to the list provided a good test- the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged, asother list members reported.This morning I piped the messages out from pine, being careful to use theRAW mode, to razor-check -d. None of the messages come back as spam, eventhe spam. Since folks revoked the false positives, I understand why theywould not come up, but not the spam itself, unless that also was revoked.Is this spam just a bad one to test against, or is there some setting inpine or razor that I am missing?-- sc-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Razor-users mailing listRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users
Hindus mourn 'monkey god'By Omer FarooqBBC reporter in HyderabadHundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which becamerevered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indianstate of Andhra Pradesh.The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysedAnimal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustionafter being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.It had not eaten for three weeks.Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally inthe presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that themonkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.GarlandedOne animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey hadfailed because of the blind faith of the people.The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animalout of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a monthago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped itaround the clock.'Exploited'Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, asthe temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups ofresidents.But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was beingmistreated.They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had beenforcibly confined in the temple.The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were beingexploited to make money.The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - butvillagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

Too many kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more efficiently for how their kids are taught. >   > > > At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and> > > counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing> > > something wrong.> > > > > > Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.> > > > > > > Maybe y'all should buy m-w some more bandwidth.> > m-w?> merriam-webster.

URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85471617Date: Not suppliedA lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not the target audience for Phoenix.Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.- The link toolbar is: - critical to my day-to-day use - vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?-  link what?- The sidebar is - indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution - not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... - a waste of real estate- Form auto-fill - is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information first - should just happen automatically- Downloads - should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! - should be clearly visible and understandable.- Toolbars should - be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and mow my lawn and... - be customizable within reason- Composer should - always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. Everywhere! - not be part of a Web browser.- Mail should - be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a difference? - be a separate application.Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to the "optional add-on" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. Why? A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions within Netscape.[1] http://www.mozillanews.org[2] http://www.mozillazine.org

The pay's not good (9,300 a year), but there is insurance, a 4,700 (I think) off a student loan, or for future education, and non-compete status for any govt. job after a year's service.  I moved to New Orleans yesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the AmeriCorps training.  I'll be setting up a community technology center which will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, like, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing?  I know.))  so that they can possibly find better jobs.  I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts of other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, etc.  The website is www.americorps.org.  There are -all- sorts of jobs all over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small salary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at.  Since Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support from dad, my load has gone down terrifically.  The IRS is after me for money I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get into a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will have to wait.  But bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when you do this type of job.  I'm up for some of that.Cindy-- "I don't take no stocks in mathematics, anyway" --Huckleberry Finn

URL: http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/25#aProductiveThreadDate: Thu, 26 Sep 2002 00:18:04 GMT"rssflowersalignright"A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway.

I've been in business for24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line ofcode for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time tomaximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much asI've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've neverever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to beresponsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I amso sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've beenusing C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never foundany decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type inthe task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by nomeans perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-partylibs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also reallyhate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to rolltogether a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing astream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relationaldatabases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open anXMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Wherecan I find C libs for those components?  On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socketwhich can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodicallyrefresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, andagain, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langaugebut Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's notready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in Cis just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How doyou evaluate these things without actually fetching every one andtrying it out?In a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see thesocial infrastructure for either happening during my professionallifetime.

OK, let's bring some data into the discussion:http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperaturefluctuations over the past 400k years).> Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and> temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest> correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases> are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the> increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature> preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done> of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are> correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly> causative.Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlationbetween temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear tobe causal.> With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to> point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly> regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.> As it> happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous> cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.Not correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and<http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recordedvalue from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growingat 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in theVostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fineresolution).> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the "historical record").Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostokrecord, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except foranthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debatingthis -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.> but it looks a lot like we> would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical> record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2> concentrations.Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quicklyspike, and then return back to "normal" background levels (and hence thespike might not show up in the ice cores).Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level thateven you would have a hard time arguing away.> Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately> affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely> predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative> feedback systems mentioned above.Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown.

I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sourcesof C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involvereductions in lifestyle to a "sustainable" level are unrealistic --Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climatechange researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during lastyear's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, andimproved efficiency is an easy sell.- Jim

What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There'spromising replacements forms, but this is the current state of theindustry: o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything. o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list.  o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the "more>" tag on the second   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except   about two dozen third world countries.  o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots. o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit. o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.   o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their   forms submission.What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wastingyour time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there'ssomeone in that company that would be willing to accept "US", "U.S", "USA""United States", "U of A", "America", etc. and would know exactly whichfreaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing themto waste even more time playing Web form geography.  I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hitthis passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one fieldthat you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice forbusiness enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submissionand hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process asworking all that well.Greg

Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);the "before custom fiddling" figures on the 3 reported runs were:    false positive percentages        0.187        0.749        0.780    total unique fp 19    false negative percentages        2.072        2.448        0.574    total unique fn 43The "total unique" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-runfp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs.Jeremy reported these "before custom fiddling" figures on 4 sets with about600 ham and spam in each:    false positive percentages        0.000        1.398        1.398        0.000        1.242        1.242        1.398        1.398        0.000        1.553        1.553        0.000    total unique fp 139    false negative percentages       10.413        6.104        5.027        8.259        2.873        5.745        5.206        4.488        9.336        5.206        5.027        9.874    total unique fn 970So things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reportedsignificant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more headerlines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's headeranalysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completelybut added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost allheader lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, allthose starting with 'x-vm').When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, Isee:    false positive percentages        0.000        0.000        0.200        0.000        0.200        0.000        0.200        0.000        0.000        0.200        0.400        0.000        0.200        0.000        0.200        0.400        0.000        0.400        0.200        0.600    total unique fp 10    false negative percentages        0.800        0.400        0.200        0.600        1.000        0.000        0.600        1.200        1.200        0.800        0.400        0.800        1.800        0.800        0.400        1.000        1.000        0.400        0.000        0.600    total unique fn 36This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another runon a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 randompairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it'snot going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If theywere in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned thealgorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.

In addition, one bit of anecdotal evidence from a conversation in1984! in San Fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate 500 to 3k.This is the only quote I could find relating to promiscuity inhomosexual men."I think people feel a certain invulnerability, especially youngpeople, like this disease doesn't affect me. The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, "That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous." Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, "Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do." If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me."You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.

Ihave a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily aroundthe 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't havereal-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of differentperiods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on thetrend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favorlowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was veryaccurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).Dan

The strangest implied claim there is that it hates MIMEindependent of HTML.  For example, the spamprob of 'content-type:text/plain'in that pickle is under 0.21.  'content-type:multipart/alternative' gets0.93, but that's not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will morethan cancel it out.WRT hating HTML, possibilities include:1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML.2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),   so that the tags aren't getting stripped.  The pickled classifier   despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage.3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the   latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for   example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just   says something like "This is an HMTL message.").If it's #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize()meaning "even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway".  In fact, I'd liketo do that and default it to True.  The extreme hatred of HTML on tech listsstrikes me as, umm, extreme <wink>.> So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).That would be a different experiment.  I'm certainly curious to see whetherJeremy's much-worse-than-mine error rates are typical or aberrant.

 ilug , From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,          Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's! regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.Michael Kamah and family.   -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

I've written complicated mission-critical server software inJava that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it issitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are runningmonths at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doinglots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sureevery conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recoversto a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is adesign/programming issue.That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and thenre-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as alanguage for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairlydetailed and low-level control of system resources to get aroundbottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't giveyou access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out ofa C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications youcould conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited byraw performance scalability.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

What you seemed toshow is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing sohelped (the "after" numbers are better than the "before" numbers, right?).Assuming that what you did was override what's nowtokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn'tcall the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you're missingcarefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding manydozens of other header fields.  There's no question that adding more headerfields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so onlybecause my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers withoutgetting major benefits for bogus reasons.Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received.  By severalaccounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I'm(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for thereason explained above.

This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.Texas Pacific, in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below, actually does invest in promising new companies, not just turnarounds. It's just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far!Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.eduTexas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendAugust 25, 2002By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG  It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed whenhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airwayslast March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leanerand meaner business plan, keep his planes flying andrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flippedthrough his files and found the number for the TexasPacific Group, an investment firm headed by DavidBonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputationfor fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filedfor bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake inAmerica West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not letTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? askedRichard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And daysbefore US Airways announced its plans to file forbankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiatedabout $550 million in concessions with its unions - TexasPacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed tokick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keepthe company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed tobuy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emergesfrom bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with abetter offer. "One of the reasons we were interested is few other folkswere," said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, inan interview after the bankruptcy filing. "There aren'tmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge todelve into the airline industry." Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buyingbusinesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bondermanmade their names during the recession of the early 1990'swith investments in Continental and America West. Thefirm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shapingcompanies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping itsextensive network of contacts for talented replacements. Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the lastyear alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed sixacquisitions, most in unloved industries likesemiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has beenlosing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also biddingfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of thesedeals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November ofMEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150million bank loan. In the last few years, most firms that specialize inleveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans andother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have mademanagements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that arefor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. Texas Pacific is different. "This is a terrific environmentfor them," said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of theBlackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of theWest, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: "Mostother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.You don't see many guys wanting to take on operationalfixes." Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keepits inner workings private: its partners rarely grantinterviews and its Web site is perpetually underconstruction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed forthis article. Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts andbright, patterned socks. "He likes argyle socks, and theytend to fall down around his ankles," said Henry Miller, aninvestment banker who advises troubled companies. Early inhis career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bondermanargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is knownfor obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekkingin places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan."Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up onmy caller I.D., I know it's David calling," said oneinvestment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as thechief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by makingearly bets in industries like cable television and takingstakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,which had been seized by the government. Over nearly adecade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annualreturn of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had alsoworked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year withMr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. The three men have complementary skills, investment bankersand other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the masterstrategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals andthe detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Priceoften recruits managers and advises on operational issues. "David is very much the optimist, very much the dealmaker," said Greg Brenneman, a former president ofContinental. "Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He willapproach investments a little bit more skeptically thanDavid does." By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was wellestablished in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billionfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000. Tocelebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented SanFrancisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at aparty. But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacifichesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made nodeals. They checked out some of the biggest corporateblowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, butstayed away, finding the prices and the quality of thebusinesses untenable. Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existinginvestments, taking more than $2 billion in profits duringthat stretch. "They started to cash out early in the cycle," said MarioGiannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a moneymanagement firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacificinvestors. The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for TexasPacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies thatneeded its help. But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in therough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the healthmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in themid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in newmanagers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italianmotorcycle maker, whose profits have since more thanquadrupled. But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought atthe top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 millioninvestment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, forwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase ofBally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demandfor luxury goods. Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, asemiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,both of which filed for bankruptcy. Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm'sperformance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings intwo investment funds it raised over the last decade. Thefirst fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 andincluding investments made through March 1997, shouldreturn more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacificinvestor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997- could return less than half that, this investorestimated, since the firm had less time to take profits onthese investments before the stock market sank. But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdingsin the second fund, profits on these investments couldrebound. It is hoping, for example, that with newmanagement in place, J. Crew will turn around as theeconomy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, "theirreturns look pretty good when you consider that some otherfunds won't return any capital" to investors. But with the weak economy throwing many companies intotrouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earliersuccess, the investor said. "They should do exceptionallywell," he said. Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. Itrelies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructuretroubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, exceptfor surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, itreplaces managers. Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as hisold friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led itto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, thenbrought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, andin October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chiefexecutive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaulof the company and is now considered a great turnaroundartist of the industry. "The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with BobFerguson," said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel forthe Federal Aviation Administration, in describing thethinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982Braniff bankruptcy. "He chose Bethune over his longtimefriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do abetter job." At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even moreextensive management overhaul. This time, the charge wasled by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job ofchief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.Parker said the two men quickly realized they had "somewhatkindred spirits." The board replaced most senior managers at America West,except William Franke, the chief executive, who steppeddown last September. His restructuring plan had made theairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged frombankruptcy in August 1994. Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worthabout $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, andthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. "These are not passive investors, nor am I," said Donald L.Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental'sboard with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. "You're active.Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake." After overseeing managers who worked successfully withunions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has agood reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airwayswas interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said ChrisChiames, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would "be as laborfriendly as possible," Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways canstill entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, thebillionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressedinterest. Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made withGoldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after twoyears of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and thechain's franchisees - even before the company, which hadbeen owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up forsale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the NationalFranchisee Association, which represents most Burger Kingfranchisees. "We liked what they had to say about the human component ofthe businesses they buy," Mr. Josephson said. Many otherowners, he added, "are dismissive of labor." At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with anexecutive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is JohnDasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwestbought out their stake in Continental in 1998. Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamoredwith the technology industry, despite the failure of somany start-ups the last two years. It has focused on thesemiconductor industry, which like the airline industry ishighly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two andtook both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most ofits stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much largerinvestment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chipmaker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis inAsia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed forbankruptcy last year. Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a thirdcompany, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more lastyear. Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing thepayment to E.On, based in Düsseldorf, Germany, was actuallymore than the acquisition, one executive close to the dealsaid. Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Companyof the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed toguarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. TexasPacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most ofwhich it swapped for more stock in the company. "They did a good job of timing the acquisition," saidNabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who notedthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profitsince the fourth quarter of 2000. But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearlysizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, AmericaWest and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discountticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines toinvest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, asPriceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web sitebut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time untilafter the sale. The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurtHotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said thatthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacificremains committed to it. Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen totalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bondermanseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down thesteep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,Mr. Peterson discovered.

But the two new species,otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously knownnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. "It's very likelythese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamentalplants from Italy," said Dr Barclay. "It looks like they're here to stay."He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department storein 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was amigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil insouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but hasestablished itself firmly in the same area.Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, andgrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. Thesoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation ofBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already afact.------------------------ Yahoo!

I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived ona couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwestand also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And myparents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations thanI have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  Ido get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-handfrom my father.The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly becauseit is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While itis true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as aconsequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, notsomething that was impressed upon them.The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entitythat exists separately from the individuals, typically an "IndianCorporation" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns asingle share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies fromtribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of thetribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k perperson, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number ofplaces, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and variousbusinesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribesare run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for theirshare no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is veryhigh unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happytake their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from thecorporation often constitutes their sole "income" for government accountingpurposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no oneworks, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain thosedividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so becausethey have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies isthat on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor whitefolk, not Indians.Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they alsoreceive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporationto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  Bybenefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no otherordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations areineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority arevery smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with goodcredentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is theHaida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, hasbillions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own havegross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet thedividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particularcase, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades beforedrawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led tointelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and haveactually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federalgovernment with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  Thisparticular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expendituresper person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and manyborrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousanddollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation ratherthan their own pockets.Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuableassets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously givenwhere feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreigncompanies.  And the cycle continues.So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In anutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, andgross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse duringpregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a verysubstantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many ofthe thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at theearliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On onereservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many ofthese societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law isarbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, policeetc).In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in ashambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that Ihave ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren'tthat many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that Icould tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unlessyou'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, butit has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the goodguys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism asa minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police areopenly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  Itwill give you an interesting perspective on things.)There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperousIndians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined andintelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second iswhere the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even ifthey maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the triballeaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathologicalcases mentioned above.The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spentby the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite highwhen you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It isjust that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well toordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  Thepoverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was myoriginal point.On a tangent:One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribalcorporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporatesocialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use thisstructure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what hasinterested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly wellover the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.It seems that in a future where "familial" ties will be increasinglyvoluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Westernsociety, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family withthe included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selectingindividuals.Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com On 9/22/02 3:53 PM, "John Hall" <johnhall@evergo.net> wrote:> > As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans> who speak english at home and those who do not.

http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson091102.aspSeptember 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.The Wages of September 11There is no going back.September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take asuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simplybecause the sun still rises and sets.This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashinginto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in realtime by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killersdealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting themanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, andcentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killinghas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morallyrepugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. Bylurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, thevampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats andbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove onlyghoulish not fearsome.The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has foundthem both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicatethem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quiteanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easilydodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make goodtheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and Britishcommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight andan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence ofthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalistparadise on earth.Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition withEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabeticnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the ColdWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade hasinsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft anantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive poweris as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on oftendubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutallyexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for themoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressedthe problems inherent in "the European way" became all too apparent:pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstractmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, andconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shirewhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, withonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved moresobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered Europeanhobbits after September 11.America learned that "moderate" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostileIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaitimeans nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any morefriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad oftheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to apre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learnthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States isjust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to comefrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistanoffer more long-term hope than "stable regimes" like the Saudis; governmentsthat hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royalfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, whichhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democraticreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamicgovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses asArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and themilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq "chickenhawks" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think ringshollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillnessagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slaveryended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all thosesoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno ofVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is nogeneration of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousandbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been insustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because Americansoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic securityis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up inlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at thePentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather thanrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroadas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable athome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots intoharm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infectthousands in high-rises.Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynicalconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimesrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loatheto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whosebelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they wereso often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive SovietCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Championsof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promiseopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments inthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, ifmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Westernconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claimnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not theLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, andidealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican presidentastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and thesubsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, wewill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.

It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new functionality I'm going to add for a while.

Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week andthursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmedlast night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Ohcome on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use itot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good storylines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if theenviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed tohave finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you wouldrather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallignon the old killsawfiles.SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and saythat B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,thier "manager"*, for  pushing them to carry out their "gay" act far toolong and just when things look to be heating up with that storyarc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronouncesthat they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its theBisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on StpehnieMcMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the firstlesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of thisaround, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thierway to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will beedited much though from the way I heard it.So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were playacting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets aface push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heatand B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe someheat time would be good for him as a single.All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered onborken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is nolonger ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shizand Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddywho goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.

For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license thepatented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitaron eBay with "Gibson" written in crayon on the headstock, and thenclaim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would getupset.    M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away,it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distributionrights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn'tstop you from making 10000 copies to sell.    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?The "other stuff" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harderto dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually preventspeople from doing it?Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do withsales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suitshould be able to "own" someone else's intellectual property.  SarahMcLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it'sthe label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildestdreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried uptomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's beenblazingly stupid with her money)But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow sothey can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problemswith beautiful-people deadbeat leech "friends" draining their riches,think again.The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until wemake the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,all it takes is looking at the same situation in a differentway.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans didthe work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, drivingmilk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  AllElvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen orcollect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted assomething of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universalstatements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs intotheir own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans paybefore they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royaltiesfor listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, fora beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and overagain for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriouslywarped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into yourthinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It'sthe people who make them; the songs are already theirs.-- Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com"Computers are useless.

I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html"Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to runon the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could berun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the fieldstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGIand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose togo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let theclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in oneimportant detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page isloaded, as JavaScript functions do.And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can accessXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using theirbrowser."==="Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes anew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figuredout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users andbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location ofservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamaidoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default"home" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-houseapplications.""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around theInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees ismore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidthconnections can download portions, or "stripes," of a file from severalcached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassemblesthese stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify thatthe downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of thisdigital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP headerfor the file."

I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizerfor mail messages.  The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-useor easy-to-customize tokenizer.The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practicalknowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn'tdesigned for re-use.  I'd like to see a module that can take a singlemessage or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to excludesome headers from his test data, because there were particular biasesin the test data.  If other people have test data without thosebiases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to includethem or exclude others.Jeremy

Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PMMOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man whosaid he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck infront of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTVtelevision reported.The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the mangot out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other detailswere immediately available.The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax andITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted totalk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, withinblocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded theman, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the newsagencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outsidethe building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and droveto a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities heldfurther negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said.

It can read right throughmisspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the authorabove suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anythinglike the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason thefirst letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important isthat without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentiallymore difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to beresolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are farless important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury theGreens.  A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed theywould have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Theirfundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrialcivilization.The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warmingtheorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that thetemperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they havebeen validated with a different means of measurement.Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing globalwarming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the"Medieval Warm Period".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not causedDIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn't trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you haveyour warming theory.Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate overlong periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedbackloops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to moreclouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a greatdeal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admitthey do clouds very poorly.A good link is:http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&CID=2051-060302A> -----Original Message-----> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf OfJim> Whitehead> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 12:23 PM> To: Robert Harley; fork@spamassassin.taint.org> Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming> > > Gary Lawrence Murphy wrote:> > >and say hello to the cool:  Oooo ... /this/ is going to cause> > some stir ...> >> > Of course not.

Typically packages use /usr/local as default(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in/usr/local/doc and so forth).Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do notfurther specify things like --exec-prefix.Maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, inwhich case ignore me!> That worked fine so I moved to the next step.> make> At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:> Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el> make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255> make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'> make: *** [w3] Error 2> > When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.

It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is"NEVER".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publicationsduring the past decade, and after using day tradingto successfully make more than four million dollars inthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't becomewealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn frommy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,secret formula for day trading that I've used profitablyyear after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.htmlMaking a mesh on the moveA new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, reports Peter RojasPeter RojasThursday August 29, 2002The GuardianImagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream.Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time "mesh-enabled" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central antennas, and improving wireless coverage.As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable.Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless connection.Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around £100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by software.It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring 3G licences.All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone networks.But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs, movies, and video games.But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks.The first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

Once upon a time, Mark wrote :> I remember apt-get dist-upgrading from 7.2 to 7.3 fine, so it -should- > work, maybe :)I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little(unimportant) catch is to replace "kernel-headers" by "glibc-kernheaders",a simple "apt-get install glibc-kernheaders" taking care of that.Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta andreleases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but differentdependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade throughapt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be consideredas the newest, thus being kept on the system.As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betasor from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'llprobably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)Matthias-- Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 PlantaSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, SpainElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

Probably because we have this pesky 1st Amendment thing here. Still, lots of us in the States have developed a disturbing tendency to shout down or (in recent years) shackle in legal BS opinions, thoughts, and individual behaviors we don't agree with.You can just ignore it if you wish.

Hello folks!I'm new to Linux, so here goes...I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driverfor it.Minicom is very much able to dial out.But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial infoof my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some scriptsomewhere).It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connectionis established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serialport using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, mefriend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired ofhaving to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back toLinux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never haveto go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).Thanks a million.Carlos-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a "public" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.GATHERING THE DATAWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their "brightness" - varies according to temperature.Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTSA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a "remarkable" level of agreement between the two.To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by "radiosonde" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions."The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement," Christy said. "If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service."These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet," Christy said. "They are not representative of the total globe."Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.GLOBAL COVERAGEOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. "Radiosonde" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard "ships of opportunity." The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSUWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERSOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local "asphalt effect" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITYWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.THE SCIENTISTSIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored "for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.DR. JOHN CHRISTYChristy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign, IL, 1983-87, an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, 1981-82, and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College, 1980-81.He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion, S.D., 1978-82, and as science master at Baptist High School, Nyeri, Kenya, 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center, and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an "invited key contributor" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change, and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.DR. ROY SPENCERSpencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison, WI, in 1981, after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC, 1984-87, before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues.

Hijacker High (8/30) Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bushijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, GailRuban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named afterher, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear.

There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbonproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed asa replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created much more easily within the petrochemical industry.Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunfloweroil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived fromwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuouslybeing developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rockoil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill thegap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of thepetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspectthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smellinglike pig farms and fish and chip shops...Robin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire********************************************************************This email and any attachments are confidential to the intendedrecipient and may also be privileged.

Dear ilug@linux.ie Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.Why do people sell their policies? The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:Pay off debts Fund long term care insurance cost Eliminate costly premiums Take advantage of other financial opportunities Make charitable contributions Help family members    Life Partners Living Solutions   Traditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death.

This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-termsignificance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put staticapplication code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most largeclient/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, becausethese are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very differentsets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People alsotend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popularwith the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistenceservices at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to aphysical architecture that has a static web server, a static applicationserver, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (Iuse the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritablebecause the "unchangeable" partitions might be written to for temporary swapspace. Who knows what Windows does internally?)My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAIDdevice that can split designated partitions into a permanent base imagepartition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple butsolid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification ofbase images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when theserver is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could thenmarket this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack thatrely on the permanent modification of system or application files via bufferoverflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorizedmodification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by thisparticular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defendapplication data. But those techniques all assume that your system itselfhas not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product couldhelp.I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for ahardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with noknowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such aproduct, I'd love to hear about it.Ben

http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.htmlLIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as "Little Chicago." Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. "The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care," Jose Sandoval, author of "Mother Aged 5," told Reuters. "We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective," he added. 'Totally willing to help'Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. "We're totally willing to help her," said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. "She got no help (in 1939) that I know about," he said. "She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true." Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. Medical rarityNo one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. Her swelling stomach worried her parents. "They thought it was a tumor," he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in "moral danger," and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. But Sandoval said: "It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them." Happy ending?Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. "We just want to get on with our lives, that's it," said Jurado, adding he thought "absolutely nothing" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. He said its value was "more or less $25,000" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. "If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property," he said. As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. "I believe there will be a happy ending," he said. "As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an eraof corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of thecountry will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon theprejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few handsand the Republic is destroyed."Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col.

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)Dear Sir, I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of us. The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was lodged into a security company here in the Country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled aspersonal belongings and as such the security company does not know the true content of the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign.

Due to the popularity of this letter onthe internet, a national weekly news program recentlydevoted an entire show to the investigation of thisprogram described below, to see if it really can makepeople money. The show also investigated whether ornot the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation inthe program and if people can 'follow the simpleinstructions' they are bound to make some mega buckswith only $25 out of pocket cost".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECTTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKINGBETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: "Thanks to thisprofitable opportunity.

I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expectin return for the minimal effort and money required.To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.==================================================Another said: "This program has been around for along time but I never believed in it.

This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================**** Take this entire letter, with the modifiedlist of names, and save it on your computer.DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you loseany data. To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the "cash" is not because this isillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :==================================================REPORT # 1: "The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net"Order Report #1 from:Robert Borowczykul.

If you do not, continue advertising orsending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders forReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system isalready working for you, and the cash will continueto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every timeyour name is moved down on the list, you are placedin front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching whichreport people are ordering from you.

One of the people you send thisto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and yourname will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the morepotential customers you will reach. So my friend,I have given you the ideas, information, materialsand opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS==============="My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================"Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big."Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada================================================="I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks."Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================="It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you. I followed thesimple instructions carefully and within 10 days themoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of thethird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand=================================================ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOURROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !=================================================If you have any questions of the legality of thisprogram, contact the Office of Associate Directorfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.This message is sent in compliance of the proposedbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. * This message is not intended for residents in theState of Washington, Virginia or California,screening of addresses has been done to the bestof our technical ability.*  This is a one time mailing and this list willnever be used again.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, was one. Google News[1] is another. In its first day, I've already noticed: - The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. - The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? - Big companies spend mucho money paying "clipping services" that send them copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

Hey,I has just been given an old Toshiba CS100 with earliest pentium and 400mbof HD but only a floppy drive on it, its got Win3.1 which is funny to seeagain but gonna be cleared as soon as i stop messing with it. What I waswondering was could anyone advise what O/S would be good for this, I want asmall usable *nix distro for it that i can transfer to it fom floppy.Connecting this to Winblows>i know that winblows allows pier-to-pierconnections over serial and parellel ports to other winblows but is thiseasy do for connecting winblows to *nix???-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie
Hi Kragen,   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a coupleof nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market willbe well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that themost important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fixtheir systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, andyou allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so youmight want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is veryimportant, which is that research into defining and addressing classesof vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of availablevulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automatedmethods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, aboutthe quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research intoa set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that youcan define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time soyou can make and test predictions.   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, wewouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the securityadmin's job would be a lot harder.AdamOn Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 08:42:12AM +0200, Eugen Leitl wrote:| -- | -- Eugen* Leitl <a href="http://leitl.org">leitl</a>| ______________________________________________________________| ICBMTO: N48 04'14.8'' E11 36'41.2'' http://eugen.leitl.org| 83E5CA02: EDE4 7193 0833 A96B 07A7  1A88 AA58 0E89 83E5 CA02| | | ---------- Forwarded message ----------| Date: Thu, 22 Aug 2002 00:24:54 -0400 (EDT)| From: Kragen Sitaker <kragen@pobox.com>| To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org| Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards| | On August 7th, an entity known as "iDEFENSE" sent out an announcement,| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, "iDEFENSE", which bills| itself as "a global security intelligence company", is offering cash| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell| anyone else.| | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.| | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research| known as "full disclosure"; people who discover security| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the| vulnerability, if possible.  | | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call "responsible| disclosure" --- never release working exploit code, and never release| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem| was.| | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and| exploit these same holes for months or years while the "responsible| disclosure" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the| underground, vulnerable.| | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as| long as possible.| | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  | | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if| HP retained Snosoft's "consulting services".  HP considered this| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the| information.| | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,| together, add up to a catastrophe.| | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.| | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be| --- just as in the "responsible disclosure" days --- that the good| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.| | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.| | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.| | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in| Samba, for example.| | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly| increase the availability of that information to the people who can| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.| | Let's not let that happen.| | | | | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:| | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]| Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program| | | Greetings,| | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.| | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:| | Q. How will it work?| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number| of motivations, including the following:| |          * Pure love of security research|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure| | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following| items:| |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided|          * The potential severity level for the information shared|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other|            software and hardware potentially affected|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE| | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other| entity.| | Q. Why are you launching this program?| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the| public at large are warned in a timely manner.| | Q. Who gets the credit?| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or| exploit information.| | Q. When can I contribute?| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.| | To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please| contact us at contributor@idefense.com.| | Regards,| | Sunil James| Technical Analyst| iDEFENSE| | "iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively| monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and| hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code.| The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline| security professionals and network administrators with timely access to| actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.| iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines| the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new| software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment."| | http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork| -- "It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."					               -Humehttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Hi allI have a prob when trying to install Linux (tried RedHat, Suse) on mylaptop. I can start the install but after about 2min, the whole pc justdies.I know it's not a Linux prob and here is what I have encountered:I had the same problem when installing Win on it and eventually sorted itout by disabling the infrared port. I'm guessing this might be same probalthough I'm not sure. I am very new to Linux so it's not that easy for meto work it out. I did manage to follow the setup procedure at one stage(using images on disks) and it cuts out either as it's trying to verify whatCD-Rom I have or just after (hence my suspicion of the infrared port again).can anyone help ?thanksGianni************************************************************************This e-mail and any files transmitted with it are confidentialand intended solely for the use of the individual or entity towhich they are addressed.

The Vocera Communications System consists of Vocera Server Software,     residing on a customer premise server, and Vocera Communications Badges,     which operate over a wireless LAN (802.11b). The badge - which weighs less     than 2 ounces - includes a microphone and speaker, LCD readout to display     text messages, and an 802.11b wireless radio. It can be clipped to a shirt     pocket or collar, or worn on a lanyard.

If youvisit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long asthe mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like partyofficials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting themail.  Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, but so what.- Lucashttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Standard Trust Bank Ltd, Lagos,Nigeria. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. Thanks and Regards, MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481566Date: Not suppliedGreat article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting computers are sent to the developing world for activist use.     For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone     lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the     nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they     cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a     day's wage for most of the population.     The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's     main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are     being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an     American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any     international shipping duties on the computers. "It's what you call real     free trade," says Eddie Nix.

These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported   to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc.  Certain RBLs too.  I don't think the   results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA   tuning and development.3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off   filters.  And, of course, there's always progression in technology   (by both spammers and non-spammers).The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsasignature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format usedby SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 orSHA-1 of each file).The third problem doesn't really worry me.These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are uniqueto spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-relatedcorpuses have their own set of problems, of course.In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for havingmultiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distributetesting and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  Ifyou're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpusof 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really thatmuch work.  If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-techniquespamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy.  And whodoesn't get thousands of non-spam every week?  ;-)Dan

I'm fairly confused here, with Procmail. I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything specific on this scenario.Here's the situation. I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of this file, I use  :0fw | spamcto call spamassassin.Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do for our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion on this point is immaterial):0  * ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR  { }:0 c $SAVEATI have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null  . . .their procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this::0  * ^From: .*spermfun.com  /dev/nullNow I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her /home/$user/.procmailrc file::0 c  !user@domain.tldIt almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with :0  * ^Subject: .*test  procmail.holderand get the same result.The result, to put it succinctly, is "nothing". No forwards go out, no files are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun example above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other messages.  In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- other users have no problems.Any suggestions would be helpful :) -Russ-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same oldcell phone?

I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own "Permit Rajs" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?-Ian.On Tuesday, August 20, 2002, at 12:09 PM, John Hall wrote:> The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails> Everywhere Else -- by Hernando De Soto	>> Is something I'm reading now.>> My impression is that France is not anywhere near the "Permit Raj"> nightmare that India is (and became).

American Indians separated from the rest of the US societywould still be considered a high-income society.

Using an existing scripting language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code
URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/08.html#in_praise_of_evolvable_formatsDate: 2002-10-08T12:28:10-05:00_Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to design a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: - It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown number of parsers around the world. - It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. - It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. - Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. - After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on. - After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers. RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication format, we have the worst one possible. Except, of course, for all the others. The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of necessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it possible in the first place. - Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. - Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed HTML elements. - Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility. Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: - Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. - Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 feed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. - Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be flourishing. Evolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. - Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. There is no middle ground. - What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces. - Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie Orgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it &#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul. Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.[1] http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html[2] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndication/message/467

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:2.5-release: 350-450 mseclatest cvs: 1000-12000 msecFrankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the user settings hasn't changed.Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?/Anders_______________________________________________Exmh-workers mailing listExmh-workers@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers
Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?==http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage StartupBy Clint BoultonAmid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in SanFrancisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase datastorage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startupwith a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices andvirtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devicesinto what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device thatis managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likesof Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus afterscouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.comthat Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possibleacquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot ofstorage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, suchas Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi."This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7or 8 system-level players," Lovington said. "Sun sees this acquisition as acritical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious."N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have arole in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styledas the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers andnetworks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining groundin the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president ofIDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largestincreases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of$411 million.Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter ofSun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.

Ananova:  Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax callsA man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating thedisappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde madethree calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted theyoungsters.He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officerstraced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to onecount of wasting police time on August 15 this year.The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the callshaving been drinking all day.Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated norcalculated but added that this was no excuse.He said: "What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he'scaused the families is unacceptable."Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he willbe sentenced.The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although thedefendant has been warned custody is an option.Story filed: 12:36 Monday 7th October 2002------------------------ Yahoo!

URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.htmlDate: Not suppliedWe're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not capturing all that information. You can always "page fault" to get the information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine (this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ bug-"tracking" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, "does FogBUGZ support custom fields?" Rather than giving our usual answer ("no. on purpose.") over the last few weeks I've been saying, "can you please tell me what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it." The interesting thing is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses. But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product. "Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields." Righto. It's true. And who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because of it. Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)[1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'dsuggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life isshowing up, right?Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bustout laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between areal church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker:"Honk if you're not sure"; Lenny Bruce: "Did you hear about how theKlan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?"; "Unitarianswould rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heavenitself."; "Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'"; etc...)But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father andan agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripeor another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanistcongregation is about as orthogonal to my presentcongenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalistpolitics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanistbit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as Iused to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and Ishow up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep acivil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguingwith them. :-).Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife oneyear after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), marriedher 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I wasjust looking to make friends as I was new in town.The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregationyou end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, someguys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You canpractically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into aroom...That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Mostregular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, inprotestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are atleast better looking than you are. :-). The only place where thereare *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics- -- but I won't go there, I promise.If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figurethat between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent'sreligions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages ofassimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out nearyou, Rohit.

URL: 4538e94b3b2c6b19041756b37b1f9916Date: Not suppliedSince the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _"FTPstore is a slight addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in sync."_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml[2] http://www.cantoni.org/software/amphetadesk.html

    Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say "Cool; I can understand this" and leave their shackles behind.  :)    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.    At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------Brian Fahrländer              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and TechnomadEvansville, IN                    My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.comICQ  5119262------------------------------------------------------------------------Just machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas withcompassion and vision.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85507259Date: Not suppliedThe Antikythera mechanism, recovered off a sunken ship in Greece in 1900, is thought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial bodies. New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool:     The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for     celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in     which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that     itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that     the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of     the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by     Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model     derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism,     were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the     second century AD.)     A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus     does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been     built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the     three other planets known at the timeMars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other     words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known     celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy,     using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the     zodiac running round its edge.

We have a partnership with Webex.  We use their serivcefor cross-firewall app sharing--something that Netmeeting/Messengerand Sametime require a lot of configuration of firewalls,authentications, access controls and user training for.  Now Webex has invites, instant meeting launch without any configuration. Users like it as now they have something to do in between Web conferences and places to store and author documents, reschedule meetings, relaunch meetings.  Webex likes it as people are signed on all the time.  GregSeptember 19, 2002  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During  and Between Online Meetings  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network  ###  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple  copies of constantly changing documents.  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also  essential.  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,  inside or outside company firewalls.  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or  "present." This enables them to chat and message each other, search across  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.  "In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries," says  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. "The powerful combination  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings."  "WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,  training, support and product design," says David Farrington, vice president  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. "By integrating the  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications."  About Magi  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming  unsecured, "read-only" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical  interface, and universal name spaces generating "follow me URLs" for mobile  professionals.  About Endeavors Technology, Inc.  Endeavors Technology, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing  and network infrastructure vendor Tadpole Technology plc (LSE-TAD,  www.tadpole.com), which has plants and offices in Irvine and Carlsbad  (California), and Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Bristol (UK).

Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PMSTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize inphysics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves innature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneeringcontributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmicX-ray sources.''Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the otherhalf of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of theUniversity of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giantunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream fromthe sun by the billion.Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings becausethey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a SouthDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrinodetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, andalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some ofthe brightest objects in the universe.The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize forbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - andsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to thediscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into thehearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outsideWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshibaalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reachDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons SydneyBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at theKarolinska Institute.The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organgrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on howviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such asAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesdaymorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory ofAlfred Nobel later the same day.The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the SwedishAcademy said on Tuesday.The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates arenot publicly revealed for 50 years.Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite whoendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given tothose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the fieldof physics.''The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry andeconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and expertsin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conductedin strict secrecy.The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.---On the Net:Nobel site, http://www.nobel.se ------------------------ Yahoo!

I'll agree that webforms are a pain in the ass, however it would seem to me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the autoform function, providing more info than you want to.  That and some entity would be holding the passport info, thus have all that data in the first place.Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to market to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability they'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was tracked to you.  And thats just the marketing side of it.ChrisOn Sat, 28 Sep 2002, Gregory Alan Bolcer wrote:> What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.

The Scotsman Thu 22 Aug 2002  Meaningful sentences   Tracey Lawson    If you ever wanted to look like "one of the most dangerous inmates in prison history", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson - the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power.   Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48, has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost.   The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry.   "I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it," is the opening paragraph penned by Bronson. "Its a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal!" You cant help feeling he has a point.   This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure.   Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of "Babs" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an award-winning film.   Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer, a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received critical praise.   And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak.   So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound.   He says: "Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills.   "It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."   However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says: "Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine the very essence of who they are.   "They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something good?"   Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege.   Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: "I can hit a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."   But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists.   "All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket," he writes, in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style. "We can all be fat lazy bastards, its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."   As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside we all needed.    Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will be available in bookstores from October at £7.99------------------------ Yahoo!

Leave your current kernel as-is2. Get the "alsa-driver" source rpm3. Rebuild and install resulting packagesDrivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and portedas easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is inmy mind. I see it more as a "one size fits all" achievement in the generalcase. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimizedfor various processors) since they all come with just about all the modulesyou'll ever need. Make that "one size fits many" then if you want ;-)Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away fromin my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up theirsystems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE andother major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happilyuse my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux releasewithout having their system turned into another Ximian mess.MatthiasPS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work!

So if they are so willing to give it, why wouldn't they be willing to give info to some silly group who may one day decide to get a hair up their ass about the practice of BDSMers?

By having every single treeand building detail and similar, you can "see" even tiny dead spots due tophysical blockage and signal attenuation.  Overlay this with fiber map datafor yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which isalso useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modelingexisting network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing furtherdeployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.  Take that and tie it into aslick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and managementsystem and you've really got something...For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

The spam often appears to originate there because it's coming from open http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.

There were some "interesting" conversations. This summer, the SEC released the following:http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htmYes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.

URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000640Date: 2002-10-06T21:28:33-06:00Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid Pipeline[1] Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. "Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it."[1] http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/pipeline0.html
BTW, I've been thinking a little about the RPMs and other packages.Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:  - perl-Mail-SpamAssassin          the perl modules.  - spamassassin          the "spamassassin" and "spamd" scripts,          spamd rc-file etc.  - spamassassin-tools          mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.          for generating rescore data from corpora.This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needsthe perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,with RC files in init.d etc.It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?--j.-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same oldcell phone?

Maybe I should just upgrade...Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40.

http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722Pro-hunt activists target top sightONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the firsttargets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the huntingdebate.Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterdayto find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during thenight.In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsmanand three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to representa Celtic god or tribal symbol.Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) ­ a radicalalternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance ­ admittedresponsibility last night for targeting the two images.The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since itwas carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in1857.But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsmanwith a horn ­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of whitecarpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White HorseAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.John Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very wellorganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with ahorn cut out of carpets."It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied itto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippingsto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It willnot get another refit for another year."Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle ­ a tractor and trailer or alorry ­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremelywell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the southof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needswhitening.Mr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to thedeterioration, which means it will need more work next time."We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come totake it away again because it was a major job."Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proudof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also carefulconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth ofvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. Therehas not been a cut in the turf ­ which would be much more of a problem. Itwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."An RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting veryfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marchesdon't seem to be doing anything good."The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocatescampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism andregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges inYorkshire thought to be RCA work.------------------------ Yahoo!

Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there(although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this isprobably a bad example), then you "apt-get update" with the new Psycherepository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say thatthere are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the otheravailable) with the same version but different dependencies :-/That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.Matthias-- Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 PlantaSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, SpainElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

I recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, "ElectronicPublishing", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the firstjournals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some ofthe better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearlyfrom 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.htmlToday's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find thisjournal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by topresearchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of theideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many forsifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishingtechnologies.Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in thecontext of their WWW7 "Evolution of Document Species" paper:Page Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization:A.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stmUS soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portabletranslation device will be an essential part of their equipment. Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of aspeech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. "This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translationsystem can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,"said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper publishedrecently. The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly findingitself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. Speaking in tongues "In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody," RobertFrederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital.  Translators could be essential for US soldiers "In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other upand you are holding them apart. "You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on andtalk to them," he said. The portable translator was developed with a year, using commerciallyavailable laptops. The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. "The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals andtypically don't have any translation support," explained Mr Frederking. Slow system For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians whoknew just a smattering of English. The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words inCroatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translatedinto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. "It went reasonably well half the time," said Mr Frederking, though it wasslow in translating phrases. The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in thefield. But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made towork with further research and development. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture betweenthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie MellonUniversity. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of     president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the     results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities     and intimidation.      [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major     U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led     by European forces. "Civilian casualties would likely be substantial," said     a French military analyst. "But the American people must be liberated from     tyranny."     [...] "Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,"     said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. "Their     single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true     parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be     retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of     the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by     the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and     poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have     a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will     require many years."    Welcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by showing them who's boss.[1] http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=127&u=/020927/7/2bxul.html&printer=1

Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger wrote it up. It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other "promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message. So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa).

IMHO.BS> BillNo offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding asign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is moreto this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is thegross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn'tthe most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that itwas.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate tothe representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as thepeople doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don'tsupport the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the ColinPowell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think thatthis is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have aright to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by thefolks they elected in the first place.My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the casessuch as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited factswe have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   Hehas a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to therepresentatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the originalthread switch that took this example and mixed in the screamingdissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness inhaving broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining thepolicy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, thescreaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away fromthe folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simplydue to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'Mygeneration never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,we just dont' know it all.I hope this clarifies my position.

On Mon, 2002-09-23 at 13:53, Jim Whitehead wrote:> > You have not explained why the increase in CO2 concentrations is not> contributing to increasing global temperature.There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important tocontrolling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may notbe anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning:Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations andtemperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modestcorrelation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increasesare not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail theincrease in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperaturepreceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are doneof the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations arecorrelated with temperature increases, but are not significantlycausative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in afairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has anauthoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important topoint out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairlyregular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cyclepeaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If thiscycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 completecyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape andtime), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As ithappens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previouscyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In otherwords, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like wewould be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historicalrecord.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2concentrations.Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimatelyaffects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirelypredictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negativefeedback systems mentioned above.Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although itmakes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water andmethane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per moleculebasis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, somethingthat CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with thebiosphere.CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recentstudies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely apassenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don'tthink it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested inunderstanding warming trends.Cheers,-James Rogers jamesr@best.com
Hi all,I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result isthat I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actuallytesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound qualitypeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit fromthat, right? ;-)I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packagesshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) andmaybe others, who knows ;-)Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)- Install this "alsa-driver" package- Install the "alsa-libs" package- Install the "alsa-utils" packageNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/(very complete and very good documentation!)Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably needto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" andinsert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! ("dmesg" tocheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels withe.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.With "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. Youcan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3files... that's it!It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The onlything I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can'timagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.dstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with thedefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib'sdevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included staticlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version againstwhich the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in therpm release, so does the architecture!).I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!Download :http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/Current spec files :http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spechttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spechttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )MatthiasPS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support!

Hi All,I'm trying to set up the following:1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and anethernet card for LAN connectivity2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server forDNS/DHCP etc.Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modemproblems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routingis all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be thedefault route or something).Is there standard "out of the box" Linux tools that will carry outportmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routableaddresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0interface).Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I needto follow ? Thanks,Dermot.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.htmlSecurity cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the catThe Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley in just four weeks.Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security cameras captured it on film.The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.He said: "It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of a hunter."It looked at me calmly before moving on."The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news of the sighting.His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images of the large cat prowling through their garden.She said: "I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate for it to get hurt."Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at "nothing" in the garden but barked that morning.He warned: "I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they might jump you."Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com------------------------ Yahoo!

I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted withhosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thingworking nice and easily.At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I haveto have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, butIt would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mailfrom the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the"To:" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying touse sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, andwhen the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I havechecked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know howto set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any ofthe outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configurationfiles like sendmail.Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  Thereare only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up forscheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do mefine.Thanks,	David.David HamiltonSenior Technical ConsultantHP Ireland -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

The received and date headers helped theclassifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham isnew.So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-headers that my mail reader added:class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):    skip = {'received': 1,            'date': 1,            'x-from_': 1,            }    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):        for k, v in msg.items():            k = k.lower()            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):                continue            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):                for t in tokenize_word(w):                    yield "%s:%s" % (k, t)This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over thetests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous testrun that used the timtest header tokenizer.It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all hamdiscriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note isthat the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spamindicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot ofMailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressingspam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who useXEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are frompeople I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They oftenstart with stuff like:> Dear Sir/Madam,> > May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly.

(If you don't use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  New in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with that old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love.  _But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] if you're not already convinced.    RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal     with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same     time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *    TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!*Enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/tramp[2] mailto:me@aaronsw.com

URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443841Date: Not suppliedBug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance policy for regressions.While this "line in the sand" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says "Capacity: 10 people." The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit PrincessThe Geodesic EconomyRobert A. HettingaSunday, August 25, 2002(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race warbetween thugs.Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gangwere the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's "family" were, ofcourse, the (mostly) Italian thugs.Think Scorsese's upcoming "Gangs of New York", only withcounter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston "social-club"putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious inhindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwritea reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets bythe Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched notfor New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI toits ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crimethere once and for all.The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin ofItalian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violencein Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by otheralso-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders ofmagnitude, not mere percentage points.As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, makeno mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that "quality"of carnage, nation-wide.So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of onegang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, atleast, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, withapparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground onthe gears of "justice" like so much hamburger.However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was"greasing", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic couldlove: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous "bluenosesand busybodies".It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent ofbeginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundythen tried to do to anything else she could think of that had asmaller, "manageable" demand. The bloody result was, like nine moreheads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, orharmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thinghappened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volsteadyears. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugelylucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violentlyscale newly-legislated "barriers to competition" imposed on them bythe state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users ofthose substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind ofevil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasinglycoercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacredliberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't needgovernment if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary toParkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money theyconfiscate at tax time.And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probablyecho here his father Milton's famous observation that governmentregulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, andnever the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are inthe increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that ourgovernment now imposes on us.And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.In fact, Hayek himself, in "The Road to Serfdom", couldn't havepredicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatantimposition, "for our own good", of Vietnam-era statist power at theneighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have hadbetter "useful idiots" than Hoover did -- and neither, by anabsolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots whowere eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middleof the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew itor not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, whichsaw the increasingly steady imposition of "mob" violence, and marketcontrol, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond theimaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian LittleCaesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and nowstrictly political, descendents.In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a "transfer-price", inhuman lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-styleVietnam-era Keynesian "social-cost" input-output accounting at itsmost despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity thatwas committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economiccontrol, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just arace war between thugs up in Boston.This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at leastfought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, andendorsed, at the time, by all the "right" people, for all the "right"reasons.As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observationthat a "prince" is just a stationary bandit.Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment ofpeople of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.Edgar Hoover a bandit "princess", instead."Bandit Queen", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --and real bandits -- everywhere.Cheers,RAH- ---------http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=topThe New York TimesAugust 25, 2002Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOXBUTTERFIELDBOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. EdgarHoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressionalinvestigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters ofNew England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,"as they were having a problem with him," according to an F.B.I. logof the conversation. "Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.," theF.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in analley, shot six times.It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau ofInvestigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-knowngangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New EnglandMafia was involved.But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the realkillers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - wereleft alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced todeath or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothingto do with it.One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice withthe Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.for $300 million for false imprisonment.His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., theJustice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Bostonoffice in its effort to bring down the mob.The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five yearsin a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some ofthe most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarcaapproved the murder. They were released as part of an investigationby the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured thedepartment into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparentlyincluding Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agentswere employing killers and gang leaders as informers and wereprotecting them from prosecution."J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminalhimself," said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. "He allowed awitness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protectone of his informants."Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati andmay have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan sharkwho worked for Mr. Barboza.Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, aspokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing thepending litigation.A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigatemisconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of theinvestigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaitingsentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering andobstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who wereF.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent andStephen Flemmi are brothers.The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Bostonoffice to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledgethat Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,including who fired the first shot.Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know whatprogress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Bostonoffice said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshotwounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca "potentiallycould be an excellent informant."The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to havekilled seven men, "and, from all indications, he is going to continueto commit murder." Nevertheless, the agent said, "the informant'spotential outweighs the risk involved."A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. "The mostfrightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,the director does not even respond," the investigator said. "There isno message not to use a murderer as a government informant."The origin of the corruption scandal was public and politicalpressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growingpower of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close tiesto a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.Bulger.Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations andthe trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventuallyhelped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlledorganized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to takeover the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder whilethe F.B.I. looked the other way.One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressionalinvestigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening devicein his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent whotranscribed the conversation made it appear that the information wascoming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,the investigators say.Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commutedin 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still onparole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts statejudge after the Justice Department task force made public documentssuggesting his innocence.Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Theirsurvivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 millionlawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced todie in the electric chair. His life was spared only whenMassachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End withhis wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she puton the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of eachother.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI=OELD-----END PGP SIGNATURE------- -----------------R.

Recently, in private email, Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many ways encouraged. *Tools:*1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 "Jaguar" *Process:*1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for you.2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.3. In DVD Player, select "Open VIDEO_TS Folder..." from the File menu. Use the dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.

Folks,     There have been several major internet outages this morning,     across major providers UUNet, Genuity, and god knows who else.     Various routes across the Internet backbones have been     disappearing, repropagating, and disappearing again.     This has caused and exacerbated several problems which we are     working on correcting right now.

I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmailproblem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funningFreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports mywife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few otherservices (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, weget a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). Onoccasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get areconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming inwhich are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes seeover 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such anoccasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associatedwith the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razorfiles. So I have just added "-home /etc/razor" as an argument. Ihaven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whetherthis change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (Thisparagraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraphabove; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of emailprocessing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?Any ideas would be welcome.Thanks,Joe---Joe Berryjoe@topshot.comAIM "joe topshot"Yahoo Msgr "joetopshot"jabber "joetopshot@topshot.com"Baltimore, MD-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same oldcell phone?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stmBig cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards recordnumbers, a monitoring group has claimed. The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports ofanimals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigersover the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than theaverage moggy, it claims to have "firm evidence" that the majority are real.Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with thecritics and doubters, adding: "I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the samerealm as the Loch Ness monster. "But it's not, they are really out there." 'Cats with cubs' Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of thecountry. Big cat reports  Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  "This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire," he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist insufficient numbers to breed among themselves. "We have had sightings of cats with cubs," he added. 'Trigger camera' The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, includingphotographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical publicthat it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national "trigger camera" project is planned which, the society hopes,will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: "The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera andtake a picture of itself." 'Like dogs' The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into thewild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: "In the 1960s and 1970s, people had bigcats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. "But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, peoplereleased their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put themdown, or take them to a zoo."------------------------ Yahoo!

We think that quality in a game is a good thing: people like it, they keep coming back to it, and they want to play it more and more. I agree that it's a good thing. If a game has that quality, then it's probably a darn good game. But using the word "addiction" to describe that quality does us no favors with the general public.

[Guido]> Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl> Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along withcygwin1.dll.  The .exes are cmdline programs.  One is a POP3 proxy.  If Icurrently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user nametimmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, andthat my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy.  In that way theproxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail readertells it the user name is.This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and "all it does" isinsert a    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_pickedheader into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The userthen presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and "dosomething about it" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much <wink>).The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examplesof each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train theclassifier.

Well it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 tothe new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts ofdieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for thenext few weeks..In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test corefor the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wirelessap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptopI made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up thecard, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire etherhub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via thewebinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features somemore (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)but all in all a smooth move.Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots offunky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions getgoofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet betweenthe AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting11mbs and at least 60% goodness.Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal worksinthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have amicrowave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bearcat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a badthing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then Ihope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bedby vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow isheading this way....DUCKKKKK(1)http://www.linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=23&prid=173

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85519806Date: Not suppliedA San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my (non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco?     In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you     phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order,     not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request...     So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all?     In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a     driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an     employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to     independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as     disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor     drivers can't unionize.

[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident thatI can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice.  For therecord, here's how it all works:  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any "junk mail    condition" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as    "message from known spammer" (reject after every RCPT TO command),    "no message-id header", and "8-bit chars in subject" (both rejected    after the message headers/body are read).    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest    are:      - don't check for 8-bit chars in "From" header -- the vast        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a        verifiable email address in at least one of "From", "Reply-to",        and "Sender") as late as possible, because it requires DNS        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS        lookups timeout)  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject    the message.    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is    retained in saved messages.)    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is    basically this:      if virus:          folder = "virus"      else:          run through SpamAssassin          if score >= 10.0:              folder = "rejected-spam"          elif score >= 5.0:              folder = "caught-spam"    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.    By far the biggest folder will be "accepted" -- the server handles    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually    saves the message -- d'ohh!  Also haven't written anything to    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)    don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep    retrying.  D'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or    body.    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This    is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and    bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam    detectors.

For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating "/", put your /home/ filesback into place and you're ready to go.That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same changeagain. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernelparameters to save (I have to pass "pci=bios,biosirq" for one of mycomputers to work for example).HTH,Matthias-- Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 PlantaSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, SpainElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

These values of freedom> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.>> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.>> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies> against us.>> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every> turn.>> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,> contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must> be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who> saw this coming danger but failed to act.

We will strongly resist aggression from other great> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,> trade, and cultural advancement.>> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend> the benefits of freedom across the globe.

Overview of America's International Strategy>>> "Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We> fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors> liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists> and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among> the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and> open societies on every continent.">>>>>>> President Bush> West Point, New York> June 1, 2002>>>> The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength> and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of> liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with> unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great> strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that> favors freedom.>> For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great> struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and> equality.>> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and> race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and> discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we> are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by> catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must> defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.>> This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to> translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,> and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a> distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our> values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help> make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to> progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations> with other states, and respect for human dignity.>> And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.>> To achieve these goals, the United States will:>> * champion aspirations for human dignity;>> * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent> attacks against us and our friends;>> * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;>> * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our> friends, with weapons of mass destruction;>> * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and> free trade;>> * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building> the infrastructure of democracy;>> * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of> global power; and>> * transform America's national security institutions to meet the> challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.>>> II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity>>> "Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the> language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require> different methods, but not different moralities.">>>>>> President Bush> West Point, New York> June 1, 2002>>>> In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we> stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because> these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation> owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and> mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live> free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be> oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of> the secret police.>> America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human> dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;> free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;> religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.>> These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served> us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,> facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these> core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not> been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and> aspirations of their people.>> Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in> our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of> Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a> stronger, but is a freer and more just society.>> Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And> when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central> and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When> we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in> the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin> America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can> evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all> cherish.>> Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,> the national security strategy of the United States must start from> these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.>> Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international> cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation> of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international> bodies.>> We will:>> * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of> human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to> advance freedom;>> * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who> struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward> democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;>> * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key> themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation> from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights> to move toward a better future; and>> * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience> and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.>>> We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist> it.>> III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent> Attacks Against Us and Our Friends>>> "Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have> the distance of history.

(The National Cathedral)> September 14, 2001>>>> The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of> global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or> religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,> politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.>> In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a> lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed> within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United> States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals> with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who> knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.>> The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in> our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly> elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come> through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some> unseen.>> Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,> and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to> achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition> forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not> only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of> trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South> America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.>> Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist> organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,> control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will> have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.>> We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a> coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional> campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure> the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial> tools necessary to finish the task.>> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the> financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of> funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who> support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial> system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,> and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative> financial networks.>> However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the> cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we> seek.>> We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:>> * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and> international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist> organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of> terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction> (WMD) or their precursors;>> * defending the United States, the American people, and our interests> at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it> reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to> enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate> to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by> acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing> harm against our people and our country; and>> * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists> by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign> responsibilities.>>> We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international> terrorism. This includes:>> * using the full influence of the United States, and working closely> with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are> illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as> slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government> can condone or support and all must oppose;>> * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim> world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote> terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;>> * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by> enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources> on areas most at risk; and>> * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of> information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of> those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.>>> While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also> strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter> attack.>> This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization> since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council> and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland> Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental> reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland> encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public> and the private sector.>> This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,> emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with> terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened> to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and> mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop> terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.>> While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism> in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.> Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations> and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where> governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we> will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and> our allies can provide.>> As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work> with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as> non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the> humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to> rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,> threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists>> In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are> ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life.

Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts>>> "We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.> The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements> look so small.">>>>>> President Bush> Berlin, Germany> May 23, 2002>>>> Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional> disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In> an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our> alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create> horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states> falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to> alleviate suffering and restore stability.>> No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --> direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic,> and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States> will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:>> * The United States should invest time and resources into building> international relationships and institutions that can help manage local> crises when they emerge.>> * The United States should be realistic about its ability to help> those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when> people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.>>> Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will> apply these principles:>> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of> human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state> of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance> to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace> for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed> to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in> peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a> government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and> counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all> parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and> comprehensive settlement to the conflict.>> The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank> stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic> development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to> establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If> Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront> corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support> for the creation of a Palestinian state.>> Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.> Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the> United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete> steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.> As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw> fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent> with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement> activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides,> freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians> to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial> role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and> Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.>> In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India> and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested> time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and> Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a> constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With> Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's> choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more> open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to> become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century> and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our> involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in> bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan> that can help defuse military confrontation.>> Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and> respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting> the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to> employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its> neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by> Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.>> In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with> countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil,> Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic> hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,> opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as> the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States> (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of> the entire hemisphere.>> Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising> from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict> and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and> security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active> strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce> their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of> drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs> in our own country.>> In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist> groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking> activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are> working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat> illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective> sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic> security to the Colombian people.>> In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,> and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United> States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --> combating global terror. American interests and American principles,> therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an> African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.> Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's> fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous> borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence> infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.>> An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars> spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions> of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to> confronting these emerging transnational threats.>> Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that> focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This> administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the> region:>> * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South> Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement> and require focused attention;>> * coordination with European allies and international institutions is> essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace> operations; and>> * Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations> must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational> threats on a sustained basis.>>> Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the> surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are> conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically> waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to> the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a> common responsibility for democratic political systems offers> opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.>> V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends> with Weapons of Mass Destruction>>> "The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and> technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear> weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,> even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to> strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and> have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the> capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and> we will oppose them with all our power.">>>>>> President Bush> West Point, New York> June 1, 2002>>>> The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our> allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of> force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the> collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security> environment has undergone profound transformation.>> Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our> relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the> balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear> arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as> counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were> inconceivable.>> But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.> None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power> that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and> motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain> destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest> states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass> destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex> and dangerous.>> In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue> states that, while different in important ways, share a number of> attributes. These states:>> * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources> for the personal gain of the rulers;>> * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,> and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;>> * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with> other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively> to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;>> * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and>> * reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything> for which it stands.>>> At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's> designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against> Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear> weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become> the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested> increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.> Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as> well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has> become a looming threat to all nations.>> We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients> before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction> against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must> take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new> partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military> forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective> missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence> collection and analysis.>> Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:>> * Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend> against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key> capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce> capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our> homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated> into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of> our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed> adversaries.>> * Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and> terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise> necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,> arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction> assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when> necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will> continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their> increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and> threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20> billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step> forward.>> * Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD> use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of> WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such> weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading> enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States> must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our> forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.>>> It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of> this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the> United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have> in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy> of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be> caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.> We cannot let our enemies strike first.>> * In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we> faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an> effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of> retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states> more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and> the wealth of their nations.>> * In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered> weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who> used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons> of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and> military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also> allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our> allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior> of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means> of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.>> * Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a> terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the> targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death> and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between> states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to> action.>>> For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer> an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves> against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars> and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption> on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible> mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.>> We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and> objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not> seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would> fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use> of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed> and delivered covertly and without warning.>> The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian> population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law> of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001,> mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and> these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired> and used weapons of mass destruction.>> The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions> to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the> threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling> the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if> uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To> forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United> States will, if necessary, act preemptively.>> The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging> threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.> Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek> the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot> remain idle while dangers gather.>> We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our> actions. To support preemptive options, we will:>> * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide> timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;>> * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the> most dangerous threats; and>> * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to> conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.>>> The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat> to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our> actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.>> VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and> Free Trade.>>> "When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a> privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever> enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in> better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade> revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.">>>>>> President Bush> Monterrey, Mexico> March 22, 2002>>>> A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing> prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth> supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher> incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs> economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it> reinforces the habits of liberty.>> We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's> shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic> policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our> economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of> policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic> growth, including:>> * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business> investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;>> * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that> improve incentives for work and investment;>> * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are> confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic> endeavors;>> * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most> efficient use;>> * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;>> * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and> skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and>> * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the> diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and> opportunity.>>> The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not> command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the> best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further> strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for> all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the> developing world.>> A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S.> national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies> for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake> of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in> their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are> Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of> non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to> use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners --> including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they> are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher> global economic growth.>> Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic> growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand> the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging> markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise> living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a> world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that> allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in> their future.>> We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve> access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will> continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial> markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International> Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action> Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and> more effectively resolving them when they occur.>> The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from> occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing> so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy> conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on> achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,> exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.>> The concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it> became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others> value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something> that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the> freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free> trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:>> * Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we> helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,> especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for> completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the> accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade> Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.>> * Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies> in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of> the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United> States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,> targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and> government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the> poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences> allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free> trade.>> * Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the> free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration> will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and> Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of> developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.> Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will> be our principal focal points.>> * Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every> administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with> Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished> majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing> Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for> developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will> work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade> agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade> Promotion Authority.>> * Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade> policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,> competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open> societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional> integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in> developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa> Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods> produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more> use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue> to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer> countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access,> the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public> health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are> flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical> medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and> malaria.>> * Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.> Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on> enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing> disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a> global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations> that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws> against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international> community must be able to address genuine concerns about government> subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which> undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.>> * Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound> statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used> in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the> American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the> enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that> the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American> workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the> change and dynamism of open markets.>> * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster> economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with> widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental> concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy "network"> between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the> International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade> talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.>> * Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security> and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our> allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and> types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere,> Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to> work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient> technologies.>>> Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize> greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing> them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the> global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse> gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such> emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10> years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be> to:>> * remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for> international cooperation;>> * obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of> the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to> companies that can show real cuts;>> * develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission> reductions;>> * promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as> well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,> while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;>> * increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to> a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change> by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's> budget; and>> * assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas> emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and> resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and> better path.>>> VII.

(Inter-American> Development Bank)> March 14, 2002>>>> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human> race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including> all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and> opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of> U.S. international policy.>> Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic> growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served> to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and> perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars> spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction> achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.>> Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this> failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing> for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and> the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.>> This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential> of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is> impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have> implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels> of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should> set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's> poorest economies within a decade.>> The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to> achieve this goal:>> * Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of> national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core> development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our> present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,> these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge> Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest> in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight> corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest> in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and> enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward> countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those> that have not to implement reforms.>> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development> banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a> comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other> multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of> the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.> contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S.> contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the> World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African> Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing> poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially> in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral> development banks to focus on activities that increase economic> productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,> and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant> must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in> developing countries.>> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development> assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's> poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that> more children are getting a better education, more people have access to> health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a> better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure> the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering> results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own> development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral> development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for> achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA> replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation> system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time,> donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the> achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S.> contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the> World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything> that these institutions do.>> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA> agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the> poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,> sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development> banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support> development projects that show results.>> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national> security strategy.>> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor> countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics> like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be> threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest> governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective> local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new> global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than> twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.>> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of> democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20> percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher> training in Africa. The United States can also bring information> technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been> devastated by AIDS.>> * Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies,> including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields> in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.> Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits> to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still> suffer from hunger and malnutrition.>>> VIII.

To achieve this, we must:>> * expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and> able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;>> * ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate> combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;>> * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become> effective multinational fighting forces;>> * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of> scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that> they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;>> * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to> meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of> training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;> and>> * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as> we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.>>> If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a> partnership as central to the security and interests of its member> states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common> perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to> take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the> same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater> foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to> close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We> cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of> transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.>> The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances.> Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an> attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the> dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation> Enduring Freedom.

Ananova:  Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture captionReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture captionabout jewellery contained the words "let's have sex".The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languagesspoken in Namibia.Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, whichtranslates roughly as "let's have intercourse" in the Oshiwambo language.It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings fromthe femidon - female condom - as jewellery.According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIVpatients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.He intended it to mean "you will see for yourselves" in the Siyeyi tongue.One caller said the complainants "should be considerate of other people'slanguages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...Andthat the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo".Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in variousNamibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which inSiyeyi means testicles.Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambotranslates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's haveintercourse.The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.Story filed: 12:37 Tuesday 8th October 2002------------------------ Yahoo!

I'm sort of offended at having to take this question seriously,like being black and having to actually explain that black people don'tall sing and dance.  I'd guess that gay men compared to straight men havea linearly greater number of sexual partners on the order of 1.5-2X.  Butthen again, it not a monolithic or homogeneous community.

Raymond L. Wallace, 83Bigfoot Story Teller(1919-2002)Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-relatedevents, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington Stateconstruction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo resthome.It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray Wallace¹scompany building a new road through the northern California forest.   InAugust through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crewfound tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions fromtaxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprintfrom this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called ³Bigfoot.²  Crewtook the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a HumboldtCounty newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giantplaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced arevolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to today¹sglobal awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallaceand his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the restof his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallaceoffered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallacefailed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Downthrough the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fakeSasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editorsabout this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearbyguarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters andresearchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Throughhis contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly toFate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of theBigfoot mystery.In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person whocould bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot forforty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch toadulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with³care and respect² and would like to train the creature to ride around withhim in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No onecame forth with a baby Bigfoot.Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element tothe otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, WashingtonState, on November 30, 2002.©Loren Coleman 2002http://www.lorencoleman.comTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com Your use of Yahoo!

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After AllOctober 2, 2002By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN  Apparently it fell into the category "too good to check."Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that theWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blondswould become extinct within 200 years, because blondnesswas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. Thereports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC Newsprogram "Good Morning America," and on Saturday by CNN. There was only one problem, the health organization said ina statement yesterday that it never reported that blondswould become extinct, and it had never done a study on thesubject. "W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reportsoriginated," said the organization, an agency of the UnitedNations based in Geneva, "but would like to stress that wehave no opinion of the future existence of blonds." All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,cited a study from the World Health Organization - "ablonde-shell study," as The Daily Star of London put it.But none reported any scientific details from the study orthe names of the scientists who conducted it. On "Good Morning America," Charles Gibson began aconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:"There's a study from the World Health Organization, thisis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Womenand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, naturalblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earthwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene asbrunets." Ms. Sawyer said she was "somewhat of a natural blonde."Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said theanchors got the information from an ABC producer in Londonwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. In London, The Sun and The Express both reported thatunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest inScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expectedthe last true blond to hail from Finland. The British accounts were replete with the views ofbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allowblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that raregenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming anendangered species. Journalists in London said last night that the source ofthe reports was probably one of several European newsagencies that are used by the British press, but itremained unclear which one. Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said thereport was probably distributed by The Press Association,Britain's domestic news agency. "Several papers picked itup," he said. But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The PressAssociation, said that although it had considered runningthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talkingto the World Health Organization. "We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to theWorld Health Organization first," she said. "They told usthat report was two years old, and had been covered at thetime. They said it had been picked up again that day by aGerman news agency." She added that she did not know which agency theorganization was referring to. Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of Californiaat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene forblond hair "sounds patently incorrect."http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593HOW TO ADVERTISE---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contactonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution.Huh?

The tactic is stupid andnon-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tacticis just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in societyshould be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is notreally possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-).

Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stmBetamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years afterlosing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was betterquality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for thefilm rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. "With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in themarket, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult tosecure parts," Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for theformat. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in thetelevision and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffinfor Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face ofcompetition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but nonew ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like tothink about deployment.Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download aspambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questionsabout their mail setup, training and false positives, and install itas a filter.A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that caneasily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to findindividuals willing to risk this than postmasters).There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads  your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only  need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that  anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message  and that answers "spam" or "ham".  Then you have a little program  that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The  server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the  scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle  would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe  marshalling.)- Your idea here.Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?

Habeas runs something called the "Habeas Infringers List", and if you use their trademark without their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your servers as fast as you send spam.Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to town on violators.The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.--B-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications platform!

But going on that verybroad assumption, I guess I'm describingthe flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:the paisanos (who leave behind those whoremain on a patron's rural land) move toManila, and (the second assumption) squatin shantytowns there, at least until theycan line up a middle-class job.So, going on two large assumptions, I cancome up with a scenario under which titlewould take 20 years: a shantytown arisessomewhere in the midst of a section (orwhatever the Spanish used to divvy up theland) and it takes decades of arguing toput together a package which somehow canboth compensate the owner and record lotsfor the inhabitants.  Just transferringtitle to an existing lot, between partieswho have money, ought not to be a problem.The obvious solution, at least to usbarking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, isto "introduce market mechanisms".

Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got tojust run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with onlythe items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishingthe listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)    in BIOS, please.2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great   candidates) base.        I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare    hood) to feed    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent     color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.      The logo should be a coloration of a   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.Other details:USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet portshould round out the offering.  An option for just-released .13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make morereviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory cardinterfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting toUSB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.To that end, a backup solution with compression usingUSB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory mapand various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur thatsays 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.Actual 7" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation fan location for real void-comp (the test in BladeRunner) style cooling and extended bass; active coolingand airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at userseat and provide mineral water.HyperTransport ports.
http://www.irishnews.com/access/daily/current.asp?SID=421083Loo rolls of honour and the invisible manPaper Clips: A round-up of the weekly pressBy Steven McCafferyThe powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which originated in the Middle East."A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran," the columnist reports."He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands."It is then explained: "He had paid £625 to a local sorcerer and believed that he was invisible."In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery."A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through three walls to steal £10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an attack which was well planned and professional," the paper reports."The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition between the back hallway and the front shop."Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the contents."The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole left in his store and is quoted as saying: "On Monday morning when my wife was opening, everything looked normal."But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the shop next door."The paper reports that the shop was the target of "another well organised crime" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.The shop's owner says: "The closer it gets to Christmas the more people are going to be open to this."The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the Down Democrat.Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the authorities to "birch the vandals" plaguing the local community.He is shocked at reports of the "wanton destruction by vandals" and issues a call for action."The time has come to fight fire with fire," he writes, "before unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour."As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, controlled violence."It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man."Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly liberal who may oppose his plan."In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is the order of the day."You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in the late 1980s."However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before it numerically passes Christianity."-- Joe McNally :: Flaneur at Large :: http://www.flaneur.org.uk--"I am the centre which exists only because the geometry of the abyss demands it." - Fernando Pessoa--Currently playing: nothing.To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com Your use of Yahoo!

I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of hisreign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a realhands off approach, so it's funny that they would blamethe regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he didget right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behindEurope in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is somethingvery prescient in that most of those licensors have had toeat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid forvery little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to berethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in thisperiod of business innovation in the wireless space as hedidn't want the government forcing business models ontothe private sector.His full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough Igot to see his speech in person as he was part of the wholeCTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay andI hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo supportfor Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there's no differencebetween wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing.Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalablecontent (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercialfrom a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone withthe content scaling back for each target platform).The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all,but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night highroller rooms.  They put Clay in one and me in another.The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel roomsanywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)Greg[1] http://www.fcc.gov/Speeches/Powell/2001/spmkp101.html[2] http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/speeches/cb20010320.htmRohit Khare wrote:> I can't believe I actually read a laugh-out-loud funny profile of the > *FCC Commissioner* fer crissakes!

There's good design and bad design. There's good testing and bad testing.  The problemis, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobodydoes.  I think "best practices" hasn't caught upon main street Web enablement yet.  There's somereally great packages on how to do this stuff andin fact the usability people knew that Web forms neededto be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XFormsand  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot andpeople usually do.  What the problem is, they don'teven recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They justkeeping trundling along making a mess of everythingassured in their job security that they can buildWeb forms without even caring if they can beused or not beyond their test machine.If you had a piece of software and a security warningcame out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentallybroken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to knowis why would someone use Web forms best practices from5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in thattime.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windowsor Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled windowmanager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had fora brief period of time, but they are completely uselessexcept for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can't get across thebridge, then it's broken regardless of whose faultit really is, and it's the business that needs to take responsibility as they are the ones thatwanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

HelloYou may have seen this business before andignored it. I know I did - many times! However,please take a few moments to read this letter.I was amazed when the profit potential of thisbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,success in this business is now fast, easy andwell within the capabilities of ordinary peoplewho know little about internet marketing. And theearnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -follow what it says to the letter - and you will notworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who isPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never respondedto one of these before either. One day though,something just said: "You throw away $25.00 going toa movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."Believe me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would bedoing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buyingand selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!==================================================BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say "Bull", please read the following.This is the letter you have been hearing about on thenews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter onthe internet, a national weekly news program recentlydevoted an entire show to the investigation of thisprogram described below, to see if it really can makepeople money. The show also investigated whether ornot the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation inthe program and if people can 'follow the simpleinstructions' they are bound to make some mega buckswith only $25 out of pocket cost".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECTTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKINGBETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: "Thanks to thisprofitable opportunity. I was approached many timesbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expectin return for the minimal effort and money required.To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.==================================================Another said: "This program has been around for along time but I never believed in it.

To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the "cash" is not because this isillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :================================================== REPORT # 1: "The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net"Order Report #: 1 fromRui Sousa SantosP.O.

My wife, Jody and I live inChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois================================================"Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big."Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada================================================="I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks."Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================="It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you.

Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people makingwhopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, orboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the realmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-timeentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a fewdollars to over a hundred dollars just to post oneauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe acouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousandover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CANSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAYat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees whenhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF ATHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the "Dot Com" mania, and I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experiencewhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like thatyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answerYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that youwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could bemaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  Thisis no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to workto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how tobuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hotproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delaystarting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the Bulkbook!

This seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for example, I teach you where to find a product to sell.

At Fermi (yes I'm back there; long story), we're buying 4U systems like the fiscal year is ending.  We have ~20 ASA IR4US1 systems (not pushing them, there are some other similar units available), with 60 more on order.  They're 2-1/2 TB for $10K, although we add a separate IDE or SCSI system disk, because the 3Ware RAID controllers can saturate. Intel SDS2 motherboard, 2 1.4GHz P3s, 2 GB ram, 2 3Ware 7850 Raid controllers, 16 160GB Maxtors, SysKonnect gigabit enet, Fermi RedHat 7.3.http://www.asacomputers.com/cgi-bin/index.fcg?action=displayscreen&templateid=25There's some interesting info at:http://mit.fnal.gov/~msn/cdf/caf/server_evaluation.htmlWe've decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5 tree), mostly because none of the other journaled fs's can maintain >30 GB/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly GB files) with random deletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store).   Ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38MB/s to 10 with random deletions, and didn't want to do direct io at all.  Only concern is an occasional system lock-up we haven't chased down yet.  A load avg > 100 is always a patio of fun.Oddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up with the new STK 9940B tape drives, which crank along at a steady 30GB/s.  And you oldforktimers will remember "doofus" my old file server system.  It would only take 2.1" of rackspace now, instead of 14 racks.Cheers,Wayne

================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to "look before you leap" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

One of the most bizarre pages I've seen on the Web. At first I thought itmight be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebodybelieves this.===http://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htmM09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking ontheir hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears inRemote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linkedtogether and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoidderivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entitieswith little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is adescription of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people seethem. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, butnot the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Eartheven if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have arenal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.The definitive work on dragons is "The Flight of Dragons" by PeterDickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the longbow. Targets do not come much bigger.Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is thatthere were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guardtheir eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. Theysurvived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slavesbut otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of thedinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and alsoto appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remoteviewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds arecontagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can beencouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians andmind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will helpso called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have greatdifficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should removeall perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source ofSatanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thusif we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that ofall other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of theirpsi.THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears tohold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles ofrotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for younghatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which madethem very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order tokeep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do thisthey had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is anact of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop theability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first andso their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They havebecome the source of all Satans, devils and demons.Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keepthem warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) andonly starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tendto hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This isprimarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is notsuitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,even if they are standing on ice.Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an actof love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian femalecan not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a birdsitting on a nest.Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hateall enemies of their young, but this is secondary.If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, thenpurge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of ourreligions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends toconcentrate on "How to Brainwash your Neighbour". Conscious thought hasbuilt many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using"How to care for and protect one's young" as a foundation.Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something "A load ofdinosaur's eggs". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entitytends to purge all malice back to its roots.It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist onvampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing theserenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must takecontrol or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for thefollowing.Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killinghormones, abilities, etc.Mind machines.The original engraving or engram.GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. They appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were thefirst job holders.TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start oftime.My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, GalacticSubconscious, etc.EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Wheneverone hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that thehigher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like orother basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.Every extinct race, etc.BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down viagenetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.
BlogStart: **Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article fromThe Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalisedin an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billywas a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where Inow live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirelylegal, way to make money.BlogEnd: LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood...The Irish Digest July 1964The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - thearchitectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number ofbeggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of thesebeggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was onewho campaigned among the working class.  This was "Billy In The Bowl"The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole meansof transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this "bowl ", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the groundwith wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had beenborn without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowinghim with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, anunusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separatingsympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the manylonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth centuryGrangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady wouldcome along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with hisblack curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such ahandsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity."Billy in the Bowl", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the dailyowner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded weresubstantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he couldindulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March eveningas dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passingthrough Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - onDublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in aditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, thebeggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy layconcealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when twopowerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billywas travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his " bowl ", his victirn'spurse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman wasfound in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of herassailant.  And, as "Billy in the Bowl" had figured, nobody would suspect adeformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shiftingthe place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.On one occasion " Billy in "the Bowl " tried his tactics on a sturdyservant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced tostrangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murderand caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months"Billy in the Bowl" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around thisperiod, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the firstcase they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and  "Billy in the Bowl" reverted once again to his oldpasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches androbbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that anightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolledalong in his "bowl" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night thatfinished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employmentafter a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked tohear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in theditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks andtried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out herlarge hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout thedistrict and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a memberof the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy."Billy in the Bowl" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, butthey could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  TheGrangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractiveDublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughedand giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________Rev.

Forwarded-by: FlowerDid you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person issexually active or not?1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes   hair shiny and skin smooth.2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses   the pores and makes your skin glow.3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that   romantic dinner.4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.ENJOY SEX!

>>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK  Fake bank website cons victims  West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze more money out of people they had already hooked.   The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service, (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being taken in by the fake website.   The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African nations.   NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would otherwise spot the scam.   Convincing site   News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out their victims.  A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had "the" in front of the bank's name.   "I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated," said the NCIS spokesman. "It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced online."   Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people behind it have not been caught.   NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000.   The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again.  Domain games   Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any cash successfully moved out of Africa.   The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such crimes.   Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash.   Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to it.   NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con.   Cutting edge fraud   Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of legitimacy.    People tricked into clicking on fake sites  But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in place of the certificates.   "To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web technology," said the spokesman.   One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African Reserve Bank, the country's national bank.   Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has been deposited in their name.   But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead.   Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it.   Modern gloss   An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give old cons a modern gloss.   The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud.   He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be true, undoubtedly is.   One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment service Paypal.   Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information.   The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Definitional nit to pick:Robert Harley writes:> It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,> precisely identical between males and females.> > Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.You've redefined "promiscuity" above as "total" or "average" activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: activity above some specific threshold (usually "one") or norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. "Promiscuity" is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages.Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Letthere be three pairings which result in each personhaving sex once. Then, let one of the males also have sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partnersis equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are: - above the single partner threshold - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners - above the overall mode 1 acts/partnersAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) number of partners.So in this contrived population, females are more "promiscuous" than males, unless "promiscuity" is defined uselessly.- Gordon

New Tokyo toities sport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors:     Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here     unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric     charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of     body-fat ratio.     Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April     with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared     sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six     soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes,     or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.

2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict inits parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment whereTcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a "pattern - body"strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to finda pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  Thesubtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give youthe exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsingcorrectly, and was arguably wrong before.2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support inexmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else onexmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.>>>Reg Clemens said: > > If you haven't already, you should enable the debug log under > > Hacking Support preferences and look for clues there. > >  > > >>>Reg Clemens said: > >  > > Hi, > >  > >  > >  > > On Sun, 01 Sep 2002 00:05:03 MDT Reg Clemens wrote:  > >  > >    > >  > > [...] > >  > > > in messages with GnuPG signatures.

Guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his50-msg batches to score, but he's the boss so he bitches about everything<wink>.> That's profiler territory, and profiling is exactly the kind of> optimization I just said I wasn't going to do :)I haven't profiled yet, but *suspect* there aren't any egregious hot spots.5-gram'ing of long words with high-bit characters is likely overly expensive*when* it happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and as an approach tonon-English languages it sucks anyway (i.e., there's no point speedingsomething that ought to be replaced entirely).

I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.Now that I have I'm trying to resolve "breakage" and differences.The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lotmore information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot more room than I can "spare".I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouseclick that "shrinks" the Sequences window to show only thesequences in the "always show" list.  And of course a way to expand it back.--Hal_______________________________________________Exmh-workers mailing listExmh-workers@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers

[Jeremy Hylton]> I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer> for mail messages.  The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use> or easy-to-customize tokenizer.tokenize() couldn't be easier to use:  it takes a string argument, andproduces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, ortuple, or ... doesn't matter).  All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.pyand timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer woulddo any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.That's a research issue on which no work has been done.> The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical> knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't> designed for re-use.That's partly a failure of imagination <wink>.  Splitting out all knowledgeof tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it's done.Change the    from timtoken import tokenizeat the top to use any other tokenizer now.  If you want to make it easierstill, feel free to check in something better.> I'd like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of> messages and tokenize each one.The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it'shard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts ofdifferent physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in variousformats, one file per "folder", one file per msg, Skip's gzipped gimmick,...).  If you're a Python coder <wink>, you *should* find it very easy tochange the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.Defining interfaces for these guys should be done.> I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude> some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases> in the test data.

Uppity barbarians overly   fond of "risings".  Scots?  More uppity   barbarians overly fond of "risings".   Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter   next to the former and kill two birds   with one stone?Israel:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians   (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)   Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy   with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why   not plonk down a bunch of the latter next   to the former and kill two birds with one   stone?but not:India: in which the muslims and hindus were    originally intermixed to some degree,    but Partioned due to their own conflict,    not due to English resettlement policy.Canada: in which the french and english were    already established, and it was just the    balance of power on the continent that    determined events in the colonies.  The    Acadians got resettled, but they don't    seem to have been that good for picking    fights with their neighbors, so no one    had them plonked down next door.-Dave* this works best with a populace who,given "one man, one vote", immediatelydeduce "one less man, one less vote" --eh, Magnan?

Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into EndeavorsTechnology's award-winning MagiEnterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security andencryption to everyMagi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflowbetween workgroups within andbeyond the enterprise.Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costlynetwork infrastructures. Thiscombination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specificsecurity tools for each desktopapplication such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaborationcan now be rapidly, easily andsecurely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,partners and clients without concernin compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interacthighly securely with strongencryption and authentication across firewalls."In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge," saysBernard Hulme, chairman andCEO of Endeavors Technology. "Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides ITmanagers with addedassurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centricpeer-to-peer computing"Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure completeinteroperability betweenpartner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID® two-factor authentication, RSAClearTrust® Web accessmanagement, RSA BSAFE® encryption and RSA Keon® digital certificate management.The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packagingand advertising, be listed inRSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.It will also lead to jointmarketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities onjoint accounts, and 24x7 worldwidebusiness continuity support."Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterpriseproducts and streamlining thedeployment process for IT managers," says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. "Bycombining our products,enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls."About MagiMagi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secureinter- and intra-enterprisecollaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks forcollaboration very rapidly andaffordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does thisby effectively transformingunsecured, "read-only" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, throughthe use of such features ascross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal namespaces generating "follow me URLs"for mobile professionals.About RSA Security, Inc.RSA Security Inc., the most trusted name in e-security, helps organizations build secure, trusted foundationsfor e-business through its RSASecurID two-factor authentication, RSA ClearTrust Web access management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keondigital certificatemanagement product families.

Hi,First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week,but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this!- Is this with different DVDs or a single one?- Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both?- Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones?I remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgradinglibdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.Matthias-- Clean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10acpiLoad : 0.07 0.20 0.21_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

This means, for example, with a little Radio script (or an AppleScript) you could use Omni as an Instant Outliner[2].[1] http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/2002/09/25/omniOutlinerWithOpml.jpg[2] http://davenet.userland.com/2002/04/02/jonUdellOnInstantOutlining

Should Idelete the duplicates before training or not?  Would people be interested inthe script?  I'd be happy to extricate it from my local modules and check itinto CVS.Skip
I have translated the article in full - see end of post (I think that I've done a far better job than the Google translation - at least it's readable now - any correctionsappreciated).Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions to the debate.My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed.The article makes four main points.1) Absence of critical clauses. In this case, the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn't specifyunder what country's law the GPL is governed.2) Specification in English only.That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written in French.3) Arbitary licence change.The point here is that (under French law) the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily. This is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimitedin terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and times. In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim.{David Neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence.Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all *copyright holders*That's not my understanding. French law allows a GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the specific conditions of the granting of suchrights are clear - if they are not, there isnothing to stop the original author takingback "his work". The lawyers see this(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).}4) Hidden defects.Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) is/are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up and data is lost, then the authors are liable.{Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have similar clauses - the point here is that they are *_all_* invalid - just that this one affects the GPL also.Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is nota sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangementand that's why it doesn't come under this point.I would suggest that the whole thrust of thisarticle has been to see software "sales" (evenif no money changes hands) as governed verymuch by consumer law (in France anyway).Rick Moen makes the point that it is nota sale but rather a granting of rights whichare not default. See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified - under French law.The fact that two IP lawyers in France think thatthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.}5) Roughly.There may be other reasons under French law why the  GPL may be invalid.-----  Whole Article. -----------Freedom(a) is worth more than these imperfect licences.Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the "free" licences and in particular the GPL. They have published their studyin the review "Proprietes intellectuelles (Intellectual property)[1]" and theirconclusion is grim.Their approach is interesting. The problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under French law (for them the question is a moot point)but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences, and in particular the GPL. The problem is not free programmes, but rather the licence contracts of free programmes.Absence of critical clauses.The authors tell us that first of all, the reference to "copyright" is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts  (which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the Internet). The idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another. This is why, under international contracts, it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).The authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point: QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla PublicLicence).Specification in the English language.Next, the authors remind us that (at least in France), no clause in a contract may be contrary to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law in several respects. Firstly, it is written in English and the FSF doesn't officially approve translations. The "Toubon law" obliges this sort of contract to be written in French, including for businesses since the notion of "user" applies not only to consumers, but also to businesses, professionals &c. Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as far as business is concerned, the "Toubon law" is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of European directives on the subject, but whatever about that, the problem is still valid for individuals, and while waiting for it (French law) to change, French companies have to deal with it, since it is the law of the land.A programme under the GPL can suddenly change licence.Another problem, much more serious, is that according to French law, the author of a free programme can, at any time, invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence.In effect, the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of  rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees, and also with respect to its location (i.e. where such rights may be excersised)  and duration of any such grants. [3] This is not the case of the GPL nor ofother free licences. Briefly, this means that in France, or elsewhere if the author is French, that which is under the GPL could revert to proprietary from one day to the next.  The problem of the guarantee "hidden defects".An other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee. The GPL licences and others show that the software is delivered "without guarantee". You are going to immediatelyreply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts,and this is correct. However, whatever is written in a licence contract, one cannotfree oneself from the "guarantee from hidden defects", since it is imposed in the Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood by the layman, it protects the buyer(whoever it may be, individual or business, since it specifies the Civil Code and not consumer protection law) against hidden defects, deliberate or made in good faith by the seller. For example, if one buys a pair of socks in a sale, and the shop has a notice specifying that "Sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged", and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.You could have checked the socks before purchase: the flaw is deemed "obvious" andyou can sing for your money.You couldn't check the socks (they were packaged for example), and in this case, despite the notice "neither refund nor exchange", you may invoke "hidden defect" and have them changed or obtain a refund, it's up to you. Personally, I have already invoked in shops the "hidden defect" clause and it always worked well (shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the Civil Code). The concept of hidden defect is rather wide, it is necessary that you hadn't the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then (according to the Civil Code) that you wouldn't have bought it at that price if you had known about thedefect.The third case which is much rarer , is if you are able to show that the vendor hadknowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't inform you. In this case, not only does he have to reimburse the product, but all expenses incurred by the sale (metro tickets to go to the shop, the fuse which blew when you plugged it in &c.)This idea of "hidden defect" applies to all products, including programmes. This was made abundantly clear by the authorities (and the courts) surrounding Y2K. This is particularly inconvenient for free programmes, since a site which offers a Linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws.LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if in the case of a free programme, one could speak about a "hidden" defect since the source code was available, he replied "Actually, concerning the guarantee, the question of obvious defect will arise. This analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an IT professional or not". OpenSource has this advantage over the proprietary programme: it protects the distributor against a guarantee ofhidden defect insofar as the buy is an IT person. But, for distribution to the public at large, the problem remains the same.Roughly Speaking.Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored. During this interview, we asked ourselves, for example, about the fragility of the GPL clause which forbids linking source code under the GPL with proprietary code. In effect, the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with theintention of permitting interoperability with another programme. If for that,I need to link with a proprietary library (communication protocol, device driver)I may consider as "null and void" this clause of the GPL.The conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community. "Freedom" merits more than these shoddy licences, which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort.---------------------------[1] Une publication de l'Institut de recherche en propriété intellectuelle, No4 Juillet 2002[2] Une telle clause de contrat qui est opposée à ce que dit la Loi française est qualifiée en terme juridique de « clause réputée non-écrite », c'est-à-dire qu'on fait comme si cette clause n'était pas écrite dans le contrat.

Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people makingwhopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, orboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the realmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-timeentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a fewdollars to over a hundred dollars just to post oneauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe acouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousandover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CANSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAYat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees whenhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF ATHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the "Dot Com" mania, and I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experiencewhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like thatyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answerYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that youwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could bemaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  Thisis no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to workto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how tobuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hotproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delaystarting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first email campaign called "Seven Days to Bulk Email Success".  This seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for example, I teach you where to find a product to sell.

URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000616Date: 2002-09-25T18:54:10-06:00One of the weirdest things I heard when listening to the Cato Institute debate was an economist claim "a tenet of my profession is that people won't pay for something they can get for free." Someone objected, using the analogy of bottled water. There's a far better example: The New York Times.  Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called "the Web" by typing in the keyword "www.nytimes.com". Those people at the New York Times must not understand the Internet or something! More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian and others. Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the planet.

This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a betterresponse to this elsewhere.I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one Igave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server tobe scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server fordelivery.As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for loadbalancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me tobelieve that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?Thanks,V------- End of Forwarded Message --------- This message has been scanned for viruses anddangerous content by MailScanner at comp-wiz.com,and is believed to be clean.-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Spamassassin-talk mailing listSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences -> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands being issued and the responses.FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).KevinIn message <200209111917.PAA02912@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:> Hmm - I'm cc'ing the exmh-workers list, because I really don't know> much about the various PGP interfaces.

URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tildeDate: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the tilde. Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a tilde. In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a tilde in its URL. Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; (now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses. Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for #[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google Groups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ASCII characters. As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem[11]. In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements (history,tilde,job control)[16]. As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed in the APL-11 character set[18]. In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying bugs in csh). In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting this typographical pun[21]. And that's the earliest reference I can find. So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for &#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.[1]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/[2]  http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/personal/bokonon.html#words[3]  http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings[4]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/tilde.html[5]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3627ac95.66099519%40news.cs.hut.fi[6]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=an_600051281[7]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/latin1/ascii-hist.html#7E[8]  http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso646.html[9]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=735627391.AA02027%40Clone.his.com[10] http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/a/ASCII.html[11] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=14595%40shlump.nac.dec.com[12] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=CMM.0.88.616446576.cmg%40watsun.cc.columbia.edu[13] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=4036%40hoptoad.uucp[14] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=669%40kodak.UUCP[15] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3197%40jhunix.UUCP[16] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2428%40cal-asd.fluke.UUCP[17] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=778%40brl-bmd.UUCP[18] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2405%40decwrl.UUCP[19] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.ucf-cs.904[20] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.ucbcad.162[21] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.hp-pcd.546

Does anyone know what happened to vCard support in Netscape 7.0/Mozilla 1.1? (Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I presume?)Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can't find vCard or a reference to it anywhere.  I like the Netscape/Mozilla email client.  I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only (my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues.Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard?Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between the two?I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along with more PKI oriented focus.  Any wisdom would be appreciated.  In particular, I'm going to start integrating smart cards into my linux and Win32 systems and integrating them with Netscape Messenger/Mozilla and Outlook.Thankssdw

The American public couldn't careless.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives athreat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developednations aggressively engage in covert operations against Americaninterests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Thingshave stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  Forbetter or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As withmost backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the bigplayers.Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'llfind that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people areunaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.> On the other hand the Europeans are used to the peace of their cozy > post-war system where external security is not an issue. All security> threads can be resolved by giving money to the threatening people > and to integrate them into the wealthy sphere (Balkan, Palestinians,> ...)Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to dodirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually withgovernment "advisors" along for the mission).  I've always wondered whatthe deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being thatwe've acted as assassins for European governments inside their bordersagainst their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, andin recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left themilitary specifically because of the circumstances of some of thesemissions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I wasnever assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot ofcovert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never createdmeaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortionunder any other guise. > A lot of the current EU - US issues can be explained by this difference > of perception, such as the current American unilateralism (nobody wants > to help us!), the American arrogance towards Europe (they don't want to > do anything, so why should we ask them?) and the growing rejection of the > American policy in Europe (they want to abolish the law!).Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problemsthe US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhillfaster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or theEuropean way of doing things is beyond me.The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quackfor medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with "unilateral"anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans seecoming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.> My personal point is that few Americans (percentage of overall population)> have ever left their country, while even German construction workers> regularly spend their holidays in Spain. So I'm not surprised that> paranoia is growing.I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vastmajority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside thecountry at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveledanywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center ofthe universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do considerEurope to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  Butfrom the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it thisway?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over theyears.I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically andculturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughoutNorth America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major andvery distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind thehundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are trulyforeign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language withhaving the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturallyidentical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  AWyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially withyour average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the samelanguage and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit awildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, NewOrleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I livethan some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places arefarther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to aneighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than yourGerman construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculoussuperiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as theUS.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU withrelatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways verysimilar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans havedozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call anadvantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can'tunderstand a word they are saying either. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com

Between now and conclusion of the first court   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,   "pump and dump" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly   required for the spammer to get their way.Dan-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications platform!

Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over theAmerican Colonies.  And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  First of all thecolonies were not prosperous compared to England proper.  Second, theissuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  Itsounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments waseconomically crippling.  Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offeringIOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paperas the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints toomuch money.  The effects are a complete disaster.  There are a lot ofincentives that push governments into doing this even though it isincredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out ofcirculation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression wasexactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canadahad much effect.  And Canada is still a prosperous country.> -----Original Message-----> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf OfGary> Lawrence Murphy> Sent: Saturday, September 21, 2002 7:31 AM> To: Mr. FoRK> Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org> Subject: Re: sed /s/United States/Roman Empire/g> > >>>>> "f" == fork list <Mr.> writes:> >     f> "Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift>     f> whole societies out of poverty" I'm not a>     f> socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear>     f> examples?> > China?

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll be back this afternoon. My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a dictionary.[1] http://www.peerfear.org/
Congrats, in the end...> "If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was > susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"http://www.infoworld.com/articles/ct/xml/02/09/02/020902ctspotlight.xmlSecure and at easeBy Jack MccarthyAugust 30, 2002 1:01 pm PTMAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his company for a king's ransom.Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the company."This company was founded on the notion of security value," Levchin says. "Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning."Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good fortune."I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction processor," Levchin says. "We spend a lot of time designing security so it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. The trade-off is fundamental."Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and more than 3 million business accounts.Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. "There are areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore."Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's ability to carry out open communications among the millions of participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says."This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to one another," he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner."If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up," Litan says.To combat criminals, Levchin established "Igor," an antifraud program that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. "The work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has arrived."

No dumping tea in the harbour or anything like that.I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on television, and that the tactics can bejustified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and the protestors were not in anybody's face(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists andwriting checks is beyond many of us.Owen

Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from NASA...
URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.htmlDate: Not suppliedI've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 Setup program. For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll write more about what I learned.   One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516563Date: Not suppliedInterview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like:     Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and     get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have     to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to     give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry,     that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle     and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try     to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big     handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, "Hey, great to see you.     You're my new best friend for the next five minutes."     GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman.     RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a     cigarette, and you say, "Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great.     Here's my documents. How's the road?" Just small talk, because these guys     are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only     vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just     have to be cool.

With that same message base, the dbmfile weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.

It's something to keep in mind, though.I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, Ido, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scoresevery word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In anycase, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.

Then the pennydropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. Itcaused great amusement."The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about £200.A Virgin spokeswoman said: "Those determined to join the Mile HighClub will do so despite the lack of comforts."We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not somethingthat we would encourage because of air regulations."The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan"Mine is bigger than yours". Virgin is using it on flights to the FarEast and the US.

I suspect that as part of Chris' set of changes, he cleaned up theuse of the variable that was named "L" in FtocCommit (in ftoc.tcl).Its name got changed from L to linenoBut there's one reference of $L left.   That causes tracebacks ifyou attempt to use "link" with the current CVS version of exmh.I guess that most of us don't use "link" very often ... I noticed itlast week, but only got time to look and see why today.If someone with the ability to commit to the CVS repository wouldapply the following patch (to lib/ftoc.tcl) that would be nice.(It works... and is trivial, and you could perhaps just apply it bymaking the change with an editor faster than saving this patch andapplying it - there's only one instance of $L in the file, thatshould be changed to $lineno)kre

I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Thanks and regards. MR.IKE EJOH

That's wrong,immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers andthe protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus orsome of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs toget attention is fine.> That picture> will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and> France, at least. For goodness sakes, you're arguing about it on FoRK.

Was he just jacking himselfoff at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they werenot arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphingabout your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, policearresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? Thatattitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is whatyou believe.> It is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on> the nightly> news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.Sure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to getin someone's face.One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against takingout the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal publiclisten to them on matters of national security?So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if youranswr boils down to "i don't give a shit about what happens to the US", youcan kiss my ass :-)Bill

I don't say that lightly. This evening he posted a note[1] on his weblog that he was giving up trying to get RDF to make sense inside RSS. As I read his essay I could feel two-plus years of exhaustion overwhelm me. I found myself writing a comment after his essay saying, among other things "RSS is not a brilliant format. It is a compromise. It is for syndicating news feeds. That's all it is for, for the 18,000th time." It's time for RDF to pack its bags and leave. RSS deserves some dignity, as does RDF. Emphatically, once and for all, they are not the same thing. Peace be with you RDF. Leave RSS alone. Thank you.[1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002330.php

Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

Hello all,Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedbackthat I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  Idownloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks tothe help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  Istarted by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which producedsome strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/urlThat worked fine so I moved to the next step.makeAt the bottem of the text I got the following messages:Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.elmake[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'make: *** [w3] Error 2When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In sayingthat this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below arethe commands I used../configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/urlfollowed by the commands make and make install.There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package soI'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.Thanks againDarragh----- Original Message -----From: "Hunt, Bryan" <B.Hunt@emuse-tech.com>To: <macarthy@iol.ie>; <michael.conry@ucd.ie>Cc: <ilug@linux.ie>Sent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 5:08 PMSubject: OT: RE: [ILUG] Newby to Linux looking for information on cvs>> speaking of that IDE (weblogic developer) the open source version called> eclipse is free from eclipse.org If you are doing java development you> need to get this IDE .

LOL!  They're not doomed at all.  Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the dominant empowers the submissive. Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, it is creative sensuality.

The freight still isn't moving,factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, andretailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passingday. On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, thenext step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to workfor 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over thedisputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health orsafety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chaocovered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the workstoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quicklyresponded that their members have been unloading military cargothroughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but ananonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartleywould annoy labor right before congressional elections. On theother hand, "Voter discontent with Bush's handling of theincreasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up inpolls, and such concerns may have outweighed the politicaldanger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a pollreported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. "Though the administration promised an unbiasedexamination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up hismind that it was hurting national security and the economy,andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labordisputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workerssimply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78days until Christmas.

We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satelliteplayers want to join forces, the better to compete with BigCable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the JusticeDepartment, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate ofDirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US.The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposedmerger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTVand EchoStar is Dish. All straight?The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to holdoff ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the JusticeDepartment has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified"major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss withJustice in the next weeks.The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form thoserevisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequenciesto Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal forinvestors in the satellite space. It seems the market forexpanded-service television may be nearing saturation.TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, butshareholders may realize much smaller returns."The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid forDirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If thecurrent deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith DawsonEchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Dealhttp://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB103403314258094560,00.html(Paid subscription required)Regulators Set to Block EchoStar's Hughes Purchasehttp://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1033939901346228393,00.html(Paid subscription required)'Last-ditch effort' (Rocky Mountain News)http://tinyurl.com/1upiEchoStar, Hughes See a Glimmer of Hopehttp://www.thestreet.com/tech/georgemannes/10046366.htmlF.C.C.

Shouldn't a politician know not to tell the truth? Odds he's impeached bynext Monday? [ob: no-clue-how-they-remove-mayors-in-italy]Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.------------Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells WivesWed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ETMISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a womanmayor at that.Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor MartaCasiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spendingtoo much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put herclothes back on.But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if theywanted to keep their men. "The girl was very pretty and was soaking up somesun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.There's nothing we can do," Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper."Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- makethemselves more beautiful."

http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?020401fa_FACT1The New YorkerTHE NEXT WORLD ORDERby NICHOLAS LEMANNThe Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.Issue of 2002-04-01Posted 2002-03-25When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new peopleoften persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyonesuspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the BushAdministration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by afather-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believethat, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family hasresumed its governance-and about time, too.The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, orworse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense andforeign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of asClinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article inForeign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clintonof "an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of thecommander in chief." Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in thisAdministration also served under the President's father. They took officelast year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswattingby Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administrationforeign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the OvalRoom. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whosecover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of theworld, and these words:Defense Strategy for the 1990s:The Regional Defense StrategySecretary of DefenseDick CheneyJanuary 1993One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government iscommunicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even electedpoliticians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then performpublicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defenseare just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is goto meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, toexplain that some of the documents, including the report that the seniorofficial handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from ahigh-school term paper, represent the government version of playingCarnegie Hall?After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary ofDefense, set up a "shop," as they say, to think about American foreignpolicy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whoseexistence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, ata higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary ofDefense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a seniorforeign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group ofconservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, andintellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (DonaldRumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and hasbeen closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) ColinPowell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted acompeting, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagineAmerican foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on whicheach team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief PresidentBush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling thenew grand strategy.Everybody worked for months on the "five-twenty-one brief," with a sensethat the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz andPowell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, buthis briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn'tget to present his alternate version of the future of the United States inthe world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his majorforeign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day thatIraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of thematerial, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagonenvisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, preventany other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks ofcontroversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being"unilateral"-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denialsand the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheneyteam's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that thesenior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days beforeClinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a "scrubbed,"meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained theessential ideas of "shaping," rather than reacting to, the rest of theworld, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one ofskepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of thesame ideas can be found in a short book titled "From Containment to GlobalLeadership?," which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 andis now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into theClinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends thatthe United States "preclude the rise of another global rival for theindefinite future." Khalilzad writes, "It is a vital U.S. interest topreclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessaryfor the purpose."When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people aroundhim didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines ofthe policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence whichthe United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first majorforeign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that "aPresident must be a clear-eyed realist," a formulation that seems toconnote an absence of world-remaking ambition. "Realism" is exactly theforeign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partlybecause it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominatingworld affairs for any length of time.One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terroristattacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bushhas done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domesticsecurity. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are trulyentering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are thatBush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change indirection rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congresssince September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind whichhis aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment ofdestiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertivepolicymaking.Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been "atransformative moment," as the senior official I had lunch with put it, isnot so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officialshad previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the Americanpublic's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, atleast for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the "BlackHawk Down" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on theconviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombingKosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreignmilitary adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, theoptions are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,which argued that the "mass public" is much less casualty-averse than themilitary or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed thatthe public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation toprevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The Americandeath total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice'sForeign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: "The UnitedStates has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'in the absence of Soviet power." I asked her whether that is still thecase. "I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role," she saidimmediately. "I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakesthat clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief." Like Bush,she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weaponsof mass destruction "in the hands of irresponsible states" now define thenational interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech toCongress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was endingterrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face thepart of the White House grounds where television reporters do theirstandups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she doesin public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind ofmissionary calm, rather than belligerence.In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,putting forth "the notions of power politics, great powers, and powerbalances" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now shesounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney'sPentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that theother great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because ofthe terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. "Theoretically, therealists would predict that when you have a great power like the UnitedStates it would not be long before you had other great powers rising tochallenge it or trying to balance against it," Rice said. "And I think whatyou're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move toproductive and coöperative relations with the United States, rather than totry to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft mattersin how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained."Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of theNational Security Council and asked them to think seriously about "how doyou capitalize on these opportunities" to fundamentally change Americandoctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. "Ireally think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947," she said-that is,the period when the containment doctrine took shape-"in that the events soclearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a bigglobal threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normallythought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting thetectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try toseize on that and position American interests and institutions and all ofthat before they harden again."The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annualdocument called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goalsof American policy-another government report whose importance is great butnot obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as theClinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she isworking on the report now."There are two ways to handle this document," she told me. "One is to do itin a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it'simportant. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, priorto 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but Iwould think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a realstatement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic directionthat it's going."It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominantAmerican role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Somequestions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously beingasked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone inforeign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engenderinside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak acouple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensivecapability against "rogue states," departed from decades of officialadherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication ofthe scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States nowin a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the BushAdministration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly itis, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a fewmonths ago.Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggestedto me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction inforeign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz orRichard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, hepublished a book titled "The Reluctant Sheriff," in which he poked a littlefun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (hecalled it the "Pentagon Paper") and disagreed with its idea that the UnitedStates should try to be the world's only great power over the long term."For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach," Haass wrote. "Itsimply is not doable." Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another ofthe Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the"democratic zone of peace": "Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic." Haassargued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, notmore, and suggested "a revival of what might be called traditionalgreat-power politics."Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary ofDefense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in hisoffice at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was anarray of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine andthe first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington thatHaass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book."Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreignpolicy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard caseto make," he said. "It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's theeconomy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are verydifferent now. One, the President has a much easier time making the casethat foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-securitycharts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad asKennan's containment. "I think there is," he said. "What you're seeing fromthis Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body ofideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call thelimits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not tomassacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some ofthe normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left aloneinside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even leadto a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially canact in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,and not if, you're going to be attacked."Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. "I don't think the American publicneeds a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein," he said."Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make thecase. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case thatthis isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense."On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was stillmaintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not longbefore called "Imperial America," but he told me that there is a bigdifference between imperial and imperialist. "I just think that we have tobe a little bit careful," he said. "Great as our advantages are, there arestill limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas oneveryone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others tojoin us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It hasto be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can'tsend forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor."He stopped for a moment. "Is there a successor idea to containment? I thinkthere is," he said. "It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on tocertain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition toterrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policiesand then building institutions that lock them in even more."The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a newAmerican foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. Whatthe United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what'sbeen done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of theoperation itself and in terms of its aftermath.Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage ofhis aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public eventwas a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi'sleading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and formerDefense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremelyconfident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, "Evidence is mountingthat the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealingwith Saddam Hussein." The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete"until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing hisregime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt."Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with atwinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suitand a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and hissupporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient Americansupport, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated theTaliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people inWashington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebelmilitary leader ("He could fight you for the last petit four on the trayover tea at the Savoy, but that's about it," one skeptical former Pentagonofficial told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam'smilitary is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has beenquite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The UnitedStates left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to aninternal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weakernow, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing couldfinish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the ideathat a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment ofanywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American groundtroops.Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National SecurityCouncil's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the ClintonAdministration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world bypublishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authorspublished an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the IraqiNational Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn'tthink Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require asubstantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the onewe used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now inAfghanistan.Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given abriefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office inWashington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk andwalked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East werehanging. "The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion," he said, using apen as a pointer. "We're talking about two grand corps, two to threehundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in theTigris-Euphrates valley." He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra."Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board." He pointed to the Prince Sultanairbase, near Riyadh. "You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easierin Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq"-pointingagain-"because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oilfields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oilfields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend theKurds in northern Iraq." Point, point. "You go in as hard as you can, asfast as you can." He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. "You get theenemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once." Hishand hit the desk again, hard. "Then you crush him." Smack.That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removedthe government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviouslyshaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,which before September 11th clearly met the new test of nationalunacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of massdestruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country isnot wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of DanielPearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligenceservice, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must beestablished-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is noobvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawnstrong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is anuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internalaffairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, SaudiArabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to becomedirectly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wantedto do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the waythat Europe was immediately after the Second World War.In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediatemoves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is anindication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration'sconservatives. "These guys are relentless," one former official, who isclose to the high command at the State Department, told me. "Resistance isfutile." The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, isintellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and sinceSeptember 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at leastthe beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptancepractically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies thedoctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, "shaping" and expanding "the zoneof democracy," the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility withthe Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whomsee the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewiswas invited to the White House in December to brief the seniorforeign-policy staff. "One point he made is, Look, in that part of theworld, nothing matters more than resolute will and force," the seniorofficial I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn'tproceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the "Arab street," as long as it isprepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interestingthinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essaydeclared, "Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,"and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who publishedan article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime inIran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could beaccomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of thenations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going tofinish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatictour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamelyabsorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, theAdministration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance ofthe world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that theUnited States should assemble "coalitions of the willing" to support itsactions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructureof international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would testthat policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting thatit can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publiclyopposed the Iraq operation.When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it askedfor a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improvemilitary pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated asan unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war onterrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion ofIraq.This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries aboutthe invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bushbuilds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about theunacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A dramainvolving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the springand summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the termsthat Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, theenormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. TheAdministration obviously feels confident that the United States caneffectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troopbuildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause theRepublican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddamand topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to afull-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently willbegin soon.Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney'sfuture-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, nowworks in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking theWest Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet ofpublic-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication ofhis 1996 novel, "The Apprentice," quotes the Times' calling him "DickCheney's Dick Cheney," which seems like an apt description: he appearsabsolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result ofthe influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravellyrumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression ofhaving calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstructionwhich the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting forthose charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the onlytruly prudent course.When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, beforeSeptember 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have beendifferent. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the MiddleEast. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer."Let us stack it up," he said at last. "Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discoveryof the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World TradeCenter, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of aserious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobarbombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassybombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing ofthe Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and thefailure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take thatlong list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged peoplefrom supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against ourinterests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouragedfurther aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to riseup and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defendthemselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They aremorally weak.' "Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not beenstandard or foreordained. "Look at what the President has done inAfghanistan," he said, "and look at his speech to the joint session ofCongress"-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. "He made itclear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe inexpanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. Andhe had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and tobegin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there isnot a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He couldhave waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engagedin long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a newrelationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been soafraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list couldgo on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations whilestanding up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't knowyet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations notonly with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with thestates of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with thestates of Southwest Asia more generally."We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Husseinunacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. "The issue is not inspections,"Libby said. "The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of massdestruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, theirpromise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they madein '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problemsI listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraqwas given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed totake that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""What's your level of confidence," I asked him, "that the current regimewill, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?"He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spokeslowly and deliberately. "There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to haveconfidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior."-- -----------------R. A.

It is first recorded as being used by Captain Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: "I won't thrash you Tom. Shiver my timbers if I do".It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure Island/: "Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve of second-rate seafaring yarns.

This is for those that have interacted with D Winer"Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reacharound.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it."http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/===========Who's the real monster?It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone thatdares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making toostrong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they'resome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these peopleare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get theirway.Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others andimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to besure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things moveforward.  How is that being monstrous?Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public'sperception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them howthey feel about this foolishness. 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - DiscussDave deflects what he can't take the time to understandIt's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand somethingthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seekthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths offand looking like fools.What Dave does is just the opposite.Posts a link to something he doesn't understandGet's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand itDerides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.Expects others to do research for himAbuses anyone who tries to help himPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issueRealizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himselfPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocyTries making the educated people look like fools.Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to betrue.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have youfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worthtrying.One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  "It's like that movie ThePoseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that thepassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know aboutyou but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot."Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reacharound.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why wouldgood ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hellwith asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, hesavages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causingall the trouble.We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talkingamongst ourselves about it.

I haveto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. Abusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if peoplewho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are anydeal-stoppers.Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they useit!The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to bedragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  Sowith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all theircontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to startgetting rejected!Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utterfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffedwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should benice to him because he's still recovering?Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop pickingfights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.

Here's the patent application:http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 developmentefforts, and the publication of the specification.

Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from NASA...

It appears that my MH is MH 6.8.  Does NMH fix this?Actually, this issue used to escalate into a religious war. The "From " envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes inmbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with "From ". On the other hand, this breaks the assumption that the mail transport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body alone.Things like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message body.Also, strictly speaking, the mbox format envelope (or for us old-timers, the UUCP envelope) isn't just any line beginning with "From ". It's really "From", a single space, a valid email address, two spaces, and a valid date.For example:    From ptardif@nbnet.nb.ca  Sun Jul 14 08:53:57 2002        ^                   ^^-- John Abreau / Executive Director, Boston Linux & Unix IM: jabr@jabber.blu.org / abreauj@aim / abreauj@yahoo / 28611923@icqEmail jabr@blu.org / WWW http://www.abreau.net / PGP-Key-ID 0xD5C7B5D9PGP-Key-Fingerprint 72 FB 39 4F 3C 3B D6 5B E0 C8 5A 6E F1 2C BE 99   Some people say, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

As it was posted to "discussion" Ithought there'd be some.Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neilllamenting the fact that some people know how tofill out a permit so that they can take advantageof their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviouslyhe's poking fun at the idea that specific groupsget specific "zones" and that it's not up to thepolice to decide what messages and signs get put intowhat zones to most expediently keep order.  The problem is that politics have gotten so muddiednowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disruptingpolitical rallies that you don't agree with has becomecommon practice.  The courts have constantly ruledthat there are some restrictions on the first amendment.They teach you that your very first year of law school.I think that given the information as laid out by the story,Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Freespeech or even protected speech as practiced by almost every American seems to involve the ability to communicatean idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directinga specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audiencethat has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person.

If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structuremodification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason tothink that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, thenwhat we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightenedcerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughoutthe entire nervous system.

I actually like Neale's X-Spam-Disposition header, I just wonder if maybe weshould choose something with a different prefix than "X-Spam-" so thatpeople don't confuse it with SpamAssassin, all of whose headers begin withthat prefix.Also, some sort of version information would be useful.

Nobody is supposed towin all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. "A fool and his money are soon parted" and all that.  It isn't the jobof the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and Ihave grave doubts that they could even if it was their job). > They > finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off > hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not acrime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is aGovernment Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds. > So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?Perhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather notlive in a "feed lot" society, thank-you-very-much.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com

You don't think this hasanything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you?  Or that MS hasbasically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is theright way to go for most high level applications?Reza B'Far wrote:>2.

Aren't mosthigh level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns?Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code?

However, what I believe to really be thecase is that Java is one of the best languages for writing largeapplications with many components that involves the collaboration of morethan three programmers.  In those cases, it's always very hard to get theprogrammers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc.  WithJava, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around ina long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).>3.

(aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way ofdealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I'd like to know if there isone accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claimignorance...Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ isoverkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgraceto programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (noflame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religiousdiscussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every "Kid"can write a well designed Java program.  Kids typically don't understandvarious design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actuallytend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite andreinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++than in Java due to existence of standard API's.

Hi All,I have a question which is a bit tricky and waswondering of anyone has come across this problembefore or could point me in the right direction.I am involved in porting a SCO unix application toLinux, and we have encountered a problem with the waysemaphores  are being handled. The application usesmulitple processes to run application code with themain process known as the bsh which controls all i/obe it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handledvia semaphores.In certain circumstances the main process and theapplication child process seem to lock up both waitingfor the syncronisation semaphores to change state, Ihave attached ddd to the processes and it seems thatthe semaphore code is doing the correct things forsyncronisation but the processes stay stuck in thesemop() system call.I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delaybetween changing semaphore states the problem goesaway, but this causes our entire application to runreally sloooww !! lolIs there anything weird or different with the standardimplemenation of semaphores on modern linux that couldcause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in statein a semaphore immediately?Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails(-1) also fixes the problem but again systemperformance goes down the toilet.both the parent controlling process run as the sameuid, and the parent creates the semaphores withpermissions 0666.Any pointers would be appreciated!Rgds,Colin Nevin __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Everything you'll ever need on one web pagefrom News and Sport to Email and Music Chartshttp://uk.my.yahoo.com-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

Evening Standard - 28 August 2002[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA] 'Lost' penguins found alive  by Charles Miranda A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in Antarctica has been found alive in a "big huddle".  The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island.   Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: "The penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a successful breeding season over the winter."   Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the cape, may have lost up to third of its population. ------------------------ Yahoo!

No I was just a little confused because I'm running procmail on a gatewayand sits between the external sendmail box and internal exchange bridgeheadserver.  So there isn't any delivery to the local system.The only email it gets is inbound at the moment and we're looking to get ridof complication and go back to two boxes.  I did a test which looked likeyou guys are right about procmail, but testing is very limited due to theconfig I currently have.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85524596Date: Not suppliedGreat Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms, etc) floating in formaldehyde jars.     A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy     treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox,     whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T.     Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone     (other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to     make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro     Shrunken Head (it's real, it's the size of a tennis ball); conjoined     piglets in a jar; an assload of taxidermy, including a gorgeous zebra head;     giant's rings...

Some, such as yahoogroups,I can't whitelist because the from: address is the person making the post,so I will have to whitelist on another field when I can modify my code to doso.  I wonder if someone is not being careful about their submissions, or ifthese are bad mailing lists that don't drop bad mail addresses that becometrollboxes in time.Any employee who has left my company more than three years ago is eligibleto become a trollbox.  I figure after three years of bounced mail, the listshould have figured out they aren't here any more.Fox-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same oldcell phone?

The technique works for input values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85497383Date: Not suppliedThis is the headline of the month, possibly the year: "Doctors Grow Pig Teeth in Rat Intestines." Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment!     U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in     rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental     revolution.     Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment     suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a     person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her     own cells.     "The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in     biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize     dentistry," said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that     focuses on oral and facial science.

http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633932.Bizarre+London.0.htmlAn investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: "This is one of the strangest stories I have every heard."Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover why the bags contain such unusual contents."12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com------------------------ Yahoo!

More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is thecenter of the universe.  We've got the corner on electriccars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.UCI's creative writing department has been in the news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Somequotes from the article[1]:   "In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring    and uncannily timely novel. The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's "TheLovely Bones" which is on the way to the top of the NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease meabout UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobodyknew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UCschools, and when I went off to college in 1985, myrelatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's faculty called "the art of writing fiction".   If therewas ever any two classes that helped contributed to writingmy dissertation, it was that one which taught me how toget the writing flowing and my high school typing classwhich taught me how to type really fast.  One of the advantages they cite in the article is that theyseem to take a chance on the "not-so-sure" bet, but accordingto the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone onto write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industryis creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent whichcreates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out moresuccess stories which lures more talent.

Klez: The Virus That Won't Die Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.Andrew Brandt>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazinePosted Thursday, August 01, 2002The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific virus ever.And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry other viruses in them that corrupt your data....http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,103259,00.asp_______________________________________________Irregulars mailing listIrregulars@tb.tfhttp://tb.tf/mailman/listinfo/irregulars

URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020913.htmlDate: Not suppliedJohn Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet gold rush. Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.[1] http://jrobb.userland.com/stories/2002/09/11/trustbasedAdvertising.html[2] http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060081988/ref=nosim/joelonsoftware

But gradually, new computer systems came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on Tiburon's experiences in writing and rewriting the memory manager for Madden NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002.

Forwarded-by: Chris Wedgwood <cw@f00f.org>From: Bert01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn't a boy...  I'd have had    nothing to play with.02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, "Come on over; nobody's    home."  I went over. Nobody was home.03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the    other night she called me from a hotel04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging    naked. I said to the guy, "Hey buddy, why are you doing that?"  He    said "Because you came home early."05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle    came off.  I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat    kept covering me up.07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and    radio.08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She    told me that she only liked me as a friend.09. I'm so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who    came with his wallet.10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to    my father, "I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled    through."11. I'm so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was    born.12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me    find my parents. I said to him, "Do you think we'll ever find    them?" He said,"I don't know kid. There's so many places they can    hide."14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.15. I'm so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how    big I'd get.16. I went to see my doctor. "Doctor, every morning when I get up and    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What's wrong    with me?" He said...  "I don't know but your eyesight is perfect."17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, "How can I get my    kite in the air?" He told me to run off a cliff.19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.21. My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in    the electric chair.

I attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems thatJim didn't mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparentlybeen used in some fairly large implementations and looked like somepretty strong competition to commercial systems:- Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based contentmanagement framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.spamassassin.taint.org/software/ccm/cms/- OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.orgThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open sourcestrength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movementtowards improving that situation.I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took forgranted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took itjust as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignoreXML almost completely. I attended realizing that "content management" is generally used toapply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked howcompletely out of scope document management was (almost no considerationof the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than theoccasional "...and you can use FOP to make PDF" as if that wasfunctional): this seems more the case in open source content managementthan in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier toignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state ofcurrent tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd writtendown what he said, something like "it sucks so extremely, it sucks sowidely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there isno hope." For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercialsystems scaled so well that the commercial "big boys" were really muchmore functional than open source, until someone pointed out, "OK, takesome average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scalepretty well." Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): "content managementproblems are either trivial or impossible."Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3each of Mac, Linux, Windows.I am sure it wasn't news to Jim, but I can't wait to try Subversion, aCVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV:http://subversion.tigris.org/I'm also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back homesafely, they said they'd only been in America four days but were alreadyhomeless...Max

Hi,Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :- I've rebuilt a new "alsaplayer" package based on Angle's one.- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version "-fr8" of the "alsa-driver" and  "alsa-kernel" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.Both can be found here :http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for theserver that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some niftynew features : You can use any of "--with ldap", "--with mysql" and "--withpostgres" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desiredextra authentication methods and all package requirements are setaccordingly, and the release tag is changed too.http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))I think I'll use this "--with <whatever>" switch more and more wherepossible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for itsoutput targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws specto enable Pilot support.As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)MatthiasPS: Yup, I'm back from my holidays ;-)-- Clean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10Load : 2.42 2.10 1.32, AC on-line, battery charging: 100% (7:12)_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn't figure out howto enable digital out, although I'm sure if I put enough time into it,could have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,every time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed anew distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA(http://www.agnula.org/) uses Alsa as well.  Seems though the latestopen source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.

URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000647Date: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00=== Scissors === I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing.     The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my     lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying "This can't go on board." "I don't remember packing that," I said. I let her confiscate it. I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever terrorists. *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  === Waiting for Wireless === Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, you know)--I doubt they will accept it. === Irony === According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his flight. I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. "Jack!" I'd exclaim, as if we were old pals. "Going to the Eldred case?" Of course he was. "Going to be a good one." "Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?" I'd ask. "You said you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the Internet. What ever happened to that?" I imagine him mumbling and looking down at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing these airline announcements keep me up to date. === Automatic Flush Toilets === Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three times. This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web site. === Arrival === I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now for the meetings and parties. Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: "DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation." "A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed." http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government "...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio...", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a "sister nation" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, "...an article in Agence France-Presse" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an "...investment scam...". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no "fraudulent claims" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any "..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..." nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an "agreement"? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world.

The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. "Fantasy Island" -- "Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: "Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of EnenKio," another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands." http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: "Fantasy Island", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the "Melchizedek press release" you cited, indicating that "...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of EnenKio,...". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is "...another only-in- cyberspace country...", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). "Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek." Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: "Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory." **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: "I don't see much conflict between the two versions here." **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: "I will note this." **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: "I will make the necessary corrections here." **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: "I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so." (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGEJune 1, 1999: News ReleasePart One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a "press release" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, "Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said "press release" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called "Press Release": This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: Â» Â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). Â» Â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. Â» Â» was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. Â» Â» has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek Â» Â» has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - "RMI geographical and politicalboundaries." Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Â» Â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: Â» Â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). Â» Â» was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, which included the United States, China and the USSR. Â» Â» was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. Â» Â» has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. Â» Â» has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. Â» Â» has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: "With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal." On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more "remote" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice." [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of "ethnic cleansing" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

Â  His Majesty King Remios Hermios Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.Â  His Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information, contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A "State of War" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.Â  The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in "taking possession" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.Â  The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.Â  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.Â  Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the "'State of War', a Declaration" and broadcast it to the world.Â  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.Â  It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.Â  While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.Â  Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.Â  The refusal of the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.Â  Your understanding is appreciated.Â  SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGEDecember 19, 1998: News Release Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE July 14, 1998: CommuniquÃ© to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against "fraudulent claims". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual "state of war" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) "asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..." of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'Ãªtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled "Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand," of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. The published statement, "The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not "created" by Robert Moore and he is not a "Honolulu-based attorney." HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. "Enenkio" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. "Wake" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGEMay 4, 1997: News Release Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official "First Day of Issue" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in "exile". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to "Wake" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. "STATE OF WAR" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual "state of war" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the "state of war" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

The document asserts that: "A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES." This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by "Western explorers" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its "ownership" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the "natives" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more "hospitable" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, "yields to the recognition that a State of War" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. "ownership" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: Â» Â» "...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR...". Â» Â» "If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens." Â» Â» "...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all andevery action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..." Â» Â» "...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior Â» Â» "...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay." Â» Â» That the "...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process...". The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE February 6, 1995: News Release On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the "star wars" program, I am led to believe. An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called "no significant impact" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. Request for Media Response: The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of "world leadership"? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was "decommissioned" after the so-called "processing" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) Parting Shot: What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western "civilized" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of "manifest destiny" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at "fixing up the world". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. TOP OF PAGENovember 21, 1994: News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: "Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island" and stated: "Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: Â» Â» Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was "decommissioned" more than a decade ago. Â» Â» In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. Â» Â» Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. Â» Â» A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since "formal" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese "natural" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone Robert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission DO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands http://www.enenkio.org

Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking atpart of the equation.America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this isa huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  Thereis an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at theright time, to go that high.Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK isinvolved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is therest of us who tend to sort.There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in thefirst place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agreeat least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefitsof pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purityof heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally mostpeople seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be betterif it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on theForbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate farmore animosity than differences due to luck.

They don't mention Nextel, whose hullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible reception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, but the prices and network can't be beat.     T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the     company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta     Jones.     The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche     Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received     1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the     worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate     has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements.     But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average     cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents     per minute.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------What is MIME?MIME stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions".  It is thestandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using theworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sendingimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain textfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any partof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that arecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message?Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in usewhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growingnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popularMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at theUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the hostftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translationcapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you donot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there isstill hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIMEmessage.  One of the more versatile is called "munpack".  It was developedat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from thehost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versionsavailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility witholder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can alsodecode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE?Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files sothat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technicallimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robustencoding called "Base64" which has been carefully designed to survive themessage transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME?The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available viaanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including:                                                             o  US East Coast                                    Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)                                                                     o  US West Coast                                    Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)                                                                   o  Pacific Rim                                      Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)                                                               o  Europe                                           Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txtAnother source of information is the Internet news group "comp.mail.mime",which includes a periodic posting of a "Frequently Asked Questions" list.--------------------------------------------------------------------------http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Most scientists studying global climate change believe thatthese increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent forincreased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.> It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited> during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of> humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers> paved over their civilization.

I don't see any compelling reason to "save> the glaciers" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their> existence has always been transient.Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in thepast have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warmingisn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is tounderstand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures onglobal human activity.> For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are> anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll> just stick with Occam's Razor for now.The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environmentsubject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is thecurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earthshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and maybe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. Iencourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 toeventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evidentas heat.- Jim
Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files inmany places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks itis effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpointstate, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the currentfolder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences filemore than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we canstick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -Tcl has had "clock seconds" (like gettimeofday) and "clock clicks"(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibratedclock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful forrelative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microseconddelta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring allthe overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.>>>Chris Garrigues said: > > From:  Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com> > > Date:  Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700 > > > >  > > >>>Robert Elz said: > >  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the > >  > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called. > >  > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify > time, > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again. >  > Do you really think this is true?

SpamAssassin is hurting democracy!Owen---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htmInternet can level the political playing fieldBy Mike McCurry and Larry PurpuroNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in public office. While chances are high that we won't know them personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and ask for our votes.Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones through any of those channels.The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient groups.But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an advocacy management and communications software company.

Dear flatware,I'm about to undertake a massive project to index/catalog well over one thousand CDs that have been ripped to MP3 and set up a server to stream them to different rooms in the house. (Yes, I own them all, no I'm not broadcasting them to the 'net.) Can anyone give me some recommendations as to what (free? opensource?) software is best suited for this task? I know there are a few FoRKs out there who have tackled this problem before...I'd like to be able to dynamically generate play lists from queries like "Jazz released between 1950 and 1960" or "Artist such and such between these dates" or "Just these artists" or "Just this genre" - you get the idea. In addition to having multiple streams that I can tune in to (a la DMX), I'd like to be able to browse the database through a web interface from other computers in the house and pull specific music down to wherever I am.Thanks,Elias

My spamtraps are> pretty clean of viruses and bounce messages most of the time.IMO spamtrap data that's well-cleaned and monitored is fine.To my mind there's 3 types of spamtraps:  1. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps when the user closes    the account  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed    from them etc.  3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.The latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lotsof maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap datahad a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time siftingfor legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leavingthem out for this run, apart from what I'd hand-cleaned.--j.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1Say 'amen' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners atthe behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the "good"of the city, and owned by an "authority" looking for something elseto do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organizedcrime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richestnation.Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years agohave been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literallyirrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those ingovernment.As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectlyusable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, willbe "granted" away  in a potlatch that only government, andspecial-interest "communities", (or "stakeholders", or whatever thecryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organizeto such perfection.All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was foundedby a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Notreligious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.*Commerce*.If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious ludditeswho collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objectson a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called"authority" should disband itself and sell its property off to thehighest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space fora memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to thefamilies of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing theproperty, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers theevent.And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice astall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million squarefeet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesicinternetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentiallydecreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstitionand statism.It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lowerManhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, butit's going to happen sooner or later.And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those whodied at the World Trade Center.Cheers,RAH- -------http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.htmlThe Wall Street JournalSeptember 11, 2002REVIEW & OUTLOOKA Living MemorialAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into thesix-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyoneelse, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those whodied a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those whoperished would be a living one.The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts ofheroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory ofthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they wereattacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The bestexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would beto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countriesworking, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort ofproductive work and play that used to take place there. Osama binLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York hasbeen about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorousrebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when theTrade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size andscale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest nowclamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chanceto rebuild a better, more prosperous city.This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring outwhat to do with the site. In consultation with New York GovernorGeorge Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own Novemberre-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on thememorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that thecommission would have been better off setting aside a limited spacefor the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returningto the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has sosuccessfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres foran outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.A big part of the problem in New York is that the city'santi-development activists know an opening when they see one. Theywant the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates havehad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects inNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the WorldTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they arecynically using some bereaved family members to advance their ownanti-development agenda in the name of "honoring" the dead. Onefamily group even called a press conference to reject asdisrespectful a proposed train line under the site.We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confidentthat a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial centerisn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The greatcities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have allrebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urbanlife. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch portcity reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected astatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead tobe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they wereaffiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the RevolutionaryWar, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, WorldWar I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks itdisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes onaround the walls containing their names.In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond theemotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acresdevoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structureson the "footprints," which, being in the center of the site, wouldseverely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raisedhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by thepress and has since ducked for cover.Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybethose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinkingmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The bestway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273fgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2=09az-----END PGP SIGNATURE------- -----------------R.

I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, butnot quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertilenon-native population, the article implied the US was going to have asignificant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, thepopulation would overall be more youthful, with associated implications forbeing able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,etc.Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.Some actual data for the US are here:http://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdfPart of:http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/profile2000.html- Jim

However, the additional information won't be required.The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous political spam.Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade groups.FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the potential to reach more voters."We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before everyone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political messages while remaining anonymous.Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as "good for America.""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running for office," he said. "We have free speech on our side."
I have been trying to research via SA mirrors and search engines if a cannedscript exists giving clients access to their user_prefs options via aweb-based CGI interface. Numerous ISPs provide this feature to clients, butso far I can find nothing. Our configuration uses Amavis-Postfix and ClamAVfor virus filtering and Procmail with SpamAssassin for spam filtering. Iwould prefer not to have to write a script myself, but will appreciate anysuggestions.-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same oldcell phone?

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85506002Date: Not suppliedAfter the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction:     Squid on the Mantelpiece     Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the     first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot     element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic     emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming     that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to     properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when     a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the     conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary     thematics is known as the "squid on the mantelpiece."     Card Tricks in the Dark     Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private     joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia     relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and     very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose.     (Attr. Tim Powers) I had the cold from hell all weekend and I'm jetlagged, but I wanted to get some links up before I hit the sack. Until tomorrow!

This is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correctme!Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from aglobal procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called asroot, spamd won't open user_prefs files.>>From the spamc man page:       -u username           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)           then you can still use this flag.The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before runningspamc. From the procmailrc man page:       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on                   behalf of the recipient.I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!St-| -----Original Message-----| From: spamassassin-talk-admin@example.sourceforge.net| [mailto:spamassassin-talk-admin@lists.sourceforge.net]On Behalf Of| Cheryl L.

Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including "betagenics", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.htmlhttp://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.htmlhttp://www.mindprod.com/(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in.A loving person lives in a loving world,A hostile person lives in a hostile world.Everyone you meet is your mirror.You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have.The past is dead,The future is imaginary,Happiness can only bein the Eternal Now MomentHow soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.Love a person because he or she is there.This is the only reason.Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.Thepurposeof our livesis to be freeof all addictive traps,and thusbecome onewith the ocean ofLiving Love.sdw-- sdw@lig.net http://sdw.stStephen D.

Thank you Lars for your reply to my query.> SA doesnt do any of these. It is probably a function of whatever scanningsystem/MDA> you're using (amavis, procmail, whatever). What exactly are you using?I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmailas the MTA). It integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration filewith SA. All very neat.> SA in itself does nothing really. You need a frontend (procmail, amavis,etc)> at some point in the  mail delivery chain that can hand over the message> to SA and do whatever other processing you want.I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certainaction (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.Again, many thanks,Adrian-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same oldcell phone?

Turpin:>>Do we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from centuries past?Eugen Leitl:>That's easy. Divorce didn't happen.You seem not to know what a "poor man's divorce" is.It is an old term, from the time when divorce wasdifficult, but walking was easy, and identity wasnot so locked down as it is today. Not every widowhad a dead husband.>I'm seeing lack of innovation ..That doesn't tell us anything except what ishappening in Eugen Leitl's life. The more commonobservation is that the rate of change is increasing.Do you have any data that might persuade us that whatyou see is more telling than what others see?>gerontocracy favors gerontocracy.I would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotechresearch and plenty of young workers to pay taxes.Note that the fertility rate doesn't result fromdecisions made by the old, but by the young. If wewant more kids, we have to convince people who arein their twenties to become parents._________________________________________________________________Join the worlds largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. http://www.hotmail.com

These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but it's worth the wait.

Hi,This has been hashed over a few times on various lists, now I finally got around to doing something about it... You can now add"rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task" to your sources.list and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with 'apt-cache search ^task-'These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py.BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an apt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything with it.-- 	- Panu -_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.

Bush proclaimed, "The problem withthe French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur."Origins:   Yet another French fried "George W. Bush is dumb"story has been taken up by those who like their caricaturesdrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt thatemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's PresidentJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,the decline of the French economy. "The problem with theFrench," Bush afterwards confided in Blair, "is that they don'thave a word for entrepreneur."The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the BaronessWilliams of Crosby, who claimed "my good friend Tony Blair" hadrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach BaronessWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he didreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director ofcommunications and strategy. "I can tell you that the primeminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainlynever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"Campbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it musthave been a joke."This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt ofa jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less thanstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memoriestoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we'vechronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of themoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in theranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being peggedas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of theintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamusquatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would winthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, itwas the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folksto chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectualshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because theyseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about thispublic figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's everbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer atsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will alwaysfall upon appreciative ears.Barbara "ears of corn" MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

There is a software package that is used (or was up through w2k) on MicroSloth for this purpose. Ghost, or some such.

But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, itcomes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job.If the product requires occasional authentication, simple copyingwon't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue iswhether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,or just make sure that it isn't trivial.A lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to bemore concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,and so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likelyto view matters differently.> Does it really make it more secure ?Yes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the sameis ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely torequire resources other than just labour.Almost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possibleto ensure that doing so is uneconomical.> Look at the DVDs.IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; andone where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.-- Glynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>

Didn't we just have a discussion on FoRK how hardit is nowadays to write something that's notbuffer overflow protected? http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2121250,00.htmlLocation: http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2121250,00.html IM client vulnerable to attack IM client vulnerable to attack James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according toinformation security analyst John Hennessy.Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version ofTrillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that willallow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on thecomputer.Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOLInstant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a singleinterface, despite some companies actively avoiding messengerinteroperability.According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percentof the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8percent of the Internet population.David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNetAustralia the code appeared to be valid."With these sort of things you have to find some process that wouldaccept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it tocrash," he said. "Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploitit."He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run onNotepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.He said the problem was easy to fix by "writing protective code aroundthat particular piece to more closely validate the data around thatpiece.""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out thechecks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all thesebuffer overflows and exploits out there now," said Banes.Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but hadnot responded by the time of publication.------------------------------------------------------------------------For all security-related news, including updates on the latest viruses,hacking exploits and patches, check out ZDNet UK's Security News Section.Have your say instantly, and see what others have said.

For example, audio recordings have such anexemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators cancontrol what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certainindustries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke suchprivileges on. > Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you > (and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come > up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't > take it out on the rest of us.The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage inbusiness and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was everaccused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to makemoney doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no"industry outsider" can either for all intents and purposes; control ismore important than maximizing profit as long as they can make aprofit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonablebusiness behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and fewpeople swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically"investigated" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similaractivities, but that is mostly just for show.Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim toits own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capriciousprice manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.-James Rogers jamesr@best.comhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.

You know'weapons of mass destruction'. etc. etc.==http://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/10849_1467121September 20, 2002Senate Committee Passes Nanotech BillBy Roy MarkThe Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation topromote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. RonWyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Actwould create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill isco-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that wouldsupport long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effectiveeducation and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchersand professionals."The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big stepforward for this very small technology," Lieberman, who vowed to pushed tofull Senate passage before the end of the year, said. "Nowhere in the worldare the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm ofnanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent tolead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will providethe nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitatenew collaborations between government, academia, and industry that willensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation."The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnologyprogram under the National Science and Technology Council. It would alsocreate a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and NationalNanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative andtechnical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council."My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential tochange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computerrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but willmine the opportunities of nanotechnology," Wyden said in introducing thebill. "At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across ahalf-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its variousnanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leaderin this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential toachieving that goal.To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center forSocietal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related toNanotechnology would also be established.According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of theNational Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of theNational Nanotechnology Initiative in June.Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term andshort-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support researchthat falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promotinginterdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technologytransition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societalimplications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics formeasuring progress toward program goals.

So becomming a university professor was your second career choice?  ;-)Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result of some sort of quantum entanglement?Elias
I think I understand the feeling.  A few years ago I caught up witha couple of old fiancés, both now authors and notable in theirfield.  One is a minor celebrity - perhaps I should say 'was'because fame can be so fleeting and I do not know thecurrent status but she still commands buck$ on the lecturecircuit.  I authored some technical material through theyears which are probably long forgotten.  I am also 'notable',sort of, kind of, in some very narrow fields (how manymando-bass artists could there be?) so have thatfeather in my cap if I cared about it.I feel I am only a little jealous or depressed thinking about myown accomplishments (or lack thereof) - what doesbug me is that these 2 probably have some real goodjuicy stories and I'm not getting to hear any of them!!That's one reason I love this list...- SteveTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com Your use of Yahoo!

right Mike,i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion isonly that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instantshow') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i ammildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected waysonce there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they seeamongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking ontheir phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  justthat it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to familylife to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosionof images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because oftheir utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history ofphotography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changesthings 'big time'.rgds,rob-----Original Message-----From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com]Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PMTo: Rob ShavellCc: fork@spamassassin.taint.orgSubject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??Not to keep harping on this, but...At 11:36 PM 8/20/02 -0700, Rob Shavell wrote:>content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful'content>is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users>communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send>half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who>cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.This does nothing to answer my question.  I *do* care about content.  Hell,if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forthall day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convincedthat they will (stupid or not).While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the sameargument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know whocommunicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture issuch an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually findyourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?I don't buy it.For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficientmechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say notnearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades andsuch are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way toget a message across.>misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same>thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better>resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - theplant>had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digitalcamera,>and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of>decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the>photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS>didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its>greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS>traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,>SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with "you justdon't understand kids today, and they'll run with this").  I wasn't sayingthat MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn'teasy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a waythat "changed the face of communications".I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) whypeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into thephone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly seepeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them toother people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this oversending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (oroffline) photoalbum.I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own picsright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That'sone of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instantview part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want"instant view", but also "instant show".  Which is what this serviceoffers.  I'm not convinced that most people want "instant show".  I thinkpeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people puttogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them whilethey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally "instant show" is nice, butit's just "nice" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integralmessaging method.What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending itfrom one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it'ssilly if people are going to flock to it.I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS latelyare Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news eventwill happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobilephones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story ofwhat happened - before the press even gets there.Willing to be proven wrong,MikePS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly asthey currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Millions of innocentmen, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have beenburnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of thiscoercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;to support roguery and error all over the earth."SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,by John E.

The main way that spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, but by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a fairly good indication of spam.

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85506950Date: Not suppliedDan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda really entails:     So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another     helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to     restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that     communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't     explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants     permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used     to violate copyrights.     Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the     possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask     permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep     information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing     but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a     certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after     the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some     things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing.     Saying it doesn't make it so.

Cyberspace entertainment only has to be useful to the majority of its users --entertaining. That means it can tolerate a small amount of vandalism still remain useful. This is quite unlike a system required for commerce. We still have a headache of course, but at least we only need to keep the system around 90 percent clean, rather than 99.99 percent. Of course well still strive to stamp out corruption, but our system failure threshold is more achievable than one might at first assume.

Forwarded-by: Rob Windsor <windsor@warthog.com>Forwarded-by: "Dave Bruce" <dbruce@wwd.net>Forwarded by: Gary Williams <garyaw1990@aol.com>A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The card said nothing but "Maxwell House".  Mom was puzzled at first, but then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: "Good till the last drop." Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, and the card read: "Benson & Hedges".  Mom now knew to go straight to her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: "Extra Long, King Size".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words: "British Airways".  Mom took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: "Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways." Mom fainted.

There are still people who only have one partner.There are many more whoe only have one partner over "long"periods of time. So it is far from "vacuous" to describe somepeople as "promiscuous" and others as "not promiscuous", especially over a set period. ("He was promiscuous in college.He is no longer promiscuous.")The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency to gloss that meaning over with population averages. > >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.> >[...]> >so in this contrived population, females are more "promiscuous" than males,> > So 1 girl gets 1 guy, 2 girls get 2 guys, 2 guys get 1 girl, 1 guy> gets 3 girls.

Then, 1 man, let's call him "Wilt",also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men haveonly had one partner. It is now "perfectly obvious" that in thecommon meaning of the term, among this contrived population, that women are "more promiscuous" than men -- even though thesingle "most promiscuous" person, Wilt, is a man.  "Promiscuity" is not "exactly, perfectly identical between males and females", except under a degenerate custom definition of"promiscuity".> >unless "promiscuity" is defined uselessly.> > Ain't nothin' useless about averages.Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.- Gordon

All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.> Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that accrue important > state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a mountable writable partition.

802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range (also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for more reliable data transmission.Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much interference or too many clients.Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a directional antenna either way.Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 802.11...

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the "MLM Dream" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. HERE'S GOOD NEWS There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think!

As several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used to be the #1 "mark"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and Google bombing[3]. Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for "go to hell"[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for "talentless hack"[6] no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive with complaints and speculation: - New update, pagerank death?[8] - September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] - Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] (Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely false. Searching diveintomark.org for "gimli"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12], where "Gimli" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It didn't take long. - Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). - Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. - Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself (I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't that helpful. Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their results for "eminem"[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the beginning of the end of Google's reign?[1]  http://www.google.com/search?q=mark[2]  http://www.pradnetwork.com/affiliate.htm[3]  http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/[4]  http://www.google.com/search?q=%22go+to+hell%22[5]  http://www.microsoft.com/[6]  http://www.google.com/search?q=talentless+hack[7]  http://www.ohmessylife.com/[8]  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5646.htm[9]  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5688.htm[10] http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5723.htm[11] http://www.google.com/search?q=gimli+site%3Adiveintomark.org[12] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/29.html[13] http://www.google.com/search?q=reservation+hotel[14] http://www.venere.it/home/italy.html[15] http://www.venere.it/[16] http://www.google.com/search?q=news+observer+nc[17] http://www.news-observer.com/[18] http://www.linkslsgolfworld.com/king-arthur-knight-of-the-round-table.htm[19] http://www.nando.net/nt/nao/[20] http://www.google.com/search?q=eminem[21] http://www.alltheweb.com/[22] http://www.alltheweb.com/search?query=eminem
    Date:        Sun, 22 Sep 2002 22:21:49 -0700    From:        Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com>    Message-ID:  <200209230521.BAA11218@blackcomb.panasas.com>  | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in  | Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up  | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another  | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,  | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, orselected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be clearedwhen there's something else to replace it (even if the highlightingof what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdomapplication (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  Therenormally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primaryselection (that is, set it to be a null string).Then, because of the "if I get asked for the selection value, I willfind something" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insertpoint, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because thePRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothingelse has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, fromeither the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that wasdeleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal"select stuff, click at new insert point, paste" mode of operationthat almost everyone expects to work (whether the "select stuff"is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).kreps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've neverreally understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at thatpart of the code and see how it all really operates._______________________________________________Exmh-users mailing listExmh-users@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users
Politicians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole 'anonymity' thing. Also I notice this story shows the truth - the Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just a branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about Canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military HQ  in Palm Beach, Florida.'Owen----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>Staff Writer, CNET News.comAugust 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PThttp://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html <http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies.*A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online.The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice <http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada <http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in early 2003.Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty <http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the process of considering.If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden electronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. In most circumstances, a court order would be required for government agents to conduct Internet monitoring.Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty <http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted <http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, or ratified, the treaty.Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems weak."It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes," Geist said. "To me that's not a particularly convincing argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, make that case."Geist added that "there's nothing in the document that indicates (new powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems."Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act <http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies."It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies," according to the proposal. Companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center <http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "Their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not just Internet providers," Andrews said. "The cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data." EPIC opposes <http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights.Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with personal information about all Canadian Internet users. "The implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information," the draft says.Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an activist with Privacy International, calls the database "a dumb idea.""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet anonymously," Hosein said.A representative for George Radwanski <http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on the paper as it stands."Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca <mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.

I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 yearsago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don'trecall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD imageof some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that isintrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or isnot graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessaryif you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to theearly 1980s if not before.A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implementsnapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written informationmust (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that youwrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectlyadequate.It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changedand what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFSlives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have nottried it on extf3 or reiser.) BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity ofwriting to RAID4 or RAID5...I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little senseto use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least donot have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, andthere is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single diskmay hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to faultrecoveryand lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?Glenn Everhart-----Original Message-----From: bmord@icon-nicholson.com [mailto:bmord@icon-nicholson.com]Sent: Tuesday, September 03, 2002 3:04 PMTo: Webappsec Securityfocus.Com; SECPROG SecurityfocusSubject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery fromattacksHi,I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have abase disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That baseimage is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writeschanges to its own "redo" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instanceincorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present thecurrent disk image for that specific virtual machine.This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on thehoneypots mailing list)http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.htmlCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/serverapplications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.The physical architectures of most production client/server systems arelayered. For example, your basic web application might have a web serverrunning Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Netbusiness logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only oneof these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the databaseserver, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on onepartition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only thepartition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change fromone boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swapspace, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image thatshouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS orApache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. Butwhat if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a "delta" or"redo" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased theredo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would beminimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring frombackup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or highavailability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system isalways accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented atthe same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greaterperformance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also beapplied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this conceptbeen discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example inthis post, but this concept could of course be applied to most serversystems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile andnon-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightlyghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (orno) downtime.Thanks for any opinions,Ben**********************************************************************This transmission may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

Using -lm 4 is yielding an extra 20% a day, but it gets false positiveswhere it shouldn't.Such as an email with a Word doc and the signature below.

I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issuesor my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to takeforever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseenmessages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messagesrather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on tothe next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseenmessages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expectingsome different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim_______________________________________________Exmh-workers mailing listExmh-workers@redhat.comhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers

Mostsystems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've alwaysdone it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 toolswhere you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how thehardware functions.

Hi,Red Hat 8.0 is released tomorrow (monday).  I took some time out to make RPMs of GStreamer for it.All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt repository in a new "redhat-80-i386" directory.The repository for dependencies is again called "deps", and the one for the gstreamer rpms is "redhat", because this time around the base distro contains all the necessary packages.A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up athttp://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.pngHere are some known issues with the resulting rpms :a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't have a -devel package for it yetb) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.Here are the errors:INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0: undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv120__si_class_type_infoEPlugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to loadDEBUG(15299: 0)gst_plugin_load_plugin:161: attempt to load plugin "/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so"INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so failed to load: Error loading plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so, reason: /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so: undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must be something straightforward that should fix this.If anyone has a suggestion, please share ;)Thomas-- The Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/<-*-                      -*->Kiss me please kiss meKiss me out of desire baby not consolationOh you know it makes me so angry cause I know that in timeI'll only make you cry<-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*->URGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - http://urgent.rug.ac.be/_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

(BTW, it makes me wonder about the wisdom ofkeeping punctuation -- 'economy' and 'economy"' to me don't seem todeserve two be counted as clues.)    76 1.00 S '(near': 0.01; 'alexandria': 0.01; 'conn': 0.01;    'from:adam': 0.01; 'from:email addr:panix': 0.01; 'poked': 0.01;    'thorugh': 0.01; 'though': 0.03; "i'm": 0.03; 'reflect': 0.05;    "i've": 0.06; 'wednesday': 0.07; 'content-disposition:inline':    0.10; 'contacting': 0.93; 'sold': 0.96; 'financially': 0.98;    'prices': 0.98; 'rates': 0.99; 'discount.': 0.99; 'hotel': 0.99;    'hotels': 0.99; 'hotels.': 0.99; 'nights,': 0.99; 'plaza': 0.99;    'rates,': 0.99; 'rates.': 0.99; 'rooms': 0.99; 'season': 0.99;    'stations': 0.99; 'subject:Hotel': 0.99Here is the full message (Received: headers stripped), with apologiesto Ziggy and David:"""Date: Fri, 06 Sep 2002 17:17:13 -0400From: Adam Turoff <ziggy@panix.com>Subject: Hotel informationTo: guido@python.org, davida@activestate.comMessage-id: <20020906211713.GK7451@panix.com>MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-disposition: inlineUser-Agent: Mutt/1.4iI've been looking into hotels.  I poked around expedia for availabilityfrom March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday).  I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the grouprates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing acontract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financiallyresponsible for unbooked rooms).  Most hotels are less than responsive...	Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle)	$125/night, $99/weekend	State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU)	$119/night, $99/weekend	Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD)	$99/hight, $74/weekend	Windsor Park Hotel	Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations	$95/night; needs a car	Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA)	$95/nightThis is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, eventhough there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates.Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-onlydiscount.  I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either.I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june throughmid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.Z."""This one has no MIME structure nor HTML!  It even has aContent-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue.  It gotf-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-relatedterms.  I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.  (Andagain, several spam clues are duplicated with different variations:'hotel', 'hotels', 'hotels.', 'subject:Hotel', 'rates,', 'rates.'.> WRT hating HTML, possibilities include:> > 1.

Thefirst one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-).  It has lots ofHTML clues that are apparently ignored.  It was a multipart/mixed withtwo parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, amondo weird URL:http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part wasthe HTML taken directly from the above URL.

The Scotsman - 22 August 2002 Playboy wants to go out with a bang    AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000 (£160,000).   Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners, said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive young woman - preferably under 30.   "I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with me gets all the money," Mr Eden told Bild newspaper.   "I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all end with a heart attack and then Im gone."   Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be sent in quickly because of his age. "It could end very soon," he said.------------------------ Yahoo!

URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443744Date: Not suppliedI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This excerpt was rather amusing._It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, Yecies, of Netscape, said, "That's true, but the engineer who's working on it [for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape." _Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by "Netscape employee" you really meant "Apple employee." and by "always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape" you meant "was done in a weekend for Mozilla because I thought MultiZilla was cool." Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed browser that embedded WinIE. MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make of it.Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say "you should do this" or "you should do that", they get completely ignored (or blown off), but when CNet says "We didn't like this, or we didn't like that.", Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.[1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/[2] http://www.salon.com[3] http://www.mozdev.org[4] http://www.netcaptor.com

He offended conservatives and the# politically correct left with his 1998 novel "Les Particules# Elementaires" ("Atomised" in English).## Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme# admit he felt "a quiver of glee" every time a "Palestinian# terrorist" was killed.## The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in# bringing Houellebecq to trial.## France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying# Houellebecq's comments amounted to "Islamophobia" and deserved to be# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination# and racism.## The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for# sending Jews to death camps.## RESTORING BLASPHEMY?## Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.## He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the# article before it appeared.## Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.## The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to# love.## Translated into 25 languages, "Atomised" incensed France's 1968# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the# world's biggest fiction prizes.## Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.- Gordon

Also, because of the ability to send high-speed     data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable  such     as collecting seismic data at the drill bit  may now be possible.     With high-resolution seismic data collected "ahead of the bit," operators     could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet     spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency     of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a     reservoir.

                   Welcome to "Ghetto" America!...Yes, you heard me; I said "Ghetto" America! What is "Ghetto" America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is no less true! "Ghetto" America is a society of individuals comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the impoverished, and often unpolished side of "Black America;" Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community; namely the "projects" and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young "teen looking" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important "wedding band" missing from their respective ring fingers!" .And of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know that many young African American women refuse to date African American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as "Thugs" or "Street Hustlers;" Also, did you know that many young African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the "projects" rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make investments?     "Attention" This is Not another "Boyz in the Hood" Story! These newly distinguished "Black Generation Xers" are suffering through utter chaos. "Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare Abusers...Images of My America" is a collection of observations, and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths that many in "Black America," and the world in general would have you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of "Mainstream American Society." A society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or cool neighborhood reputation. The author also identifies the self-destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack of direction that currently exists in young "Black America" today.

THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just simply delete it. READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. Believe it, work it. This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders (money) started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a try!! You will be glad you did. Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't delete this!!! ------------------------------------------------------ First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET! Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. "My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year". The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. "I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old. The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down, and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues. Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills. "About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all". Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)." Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, "Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee. [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions]. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! ================================================== You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================================Here is another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''

DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================================ Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ================================================================ REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================================ Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. ===================AVAILABLE REPORTS ========================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ====================== MORE TESTIMONIALS====================== '' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================================ '' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''. Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================================ '' I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. =============================================================== '' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00.

http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1012------- Additional Comments From easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu  2002-09-21 16:41 -------I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely "Evolutionary Programming", sincethe parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, notcrossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there arebetween different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with thesuspiciously-high "anti-ratware" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,what's needed are one or more of the below:        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow           for having "correlated" mutations - in other words, have a           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the           "Evolutionary Strategies" of Schwefel;        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a           fifth of the new "individuals" are doing about as well as, or           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less           parameters.        -Allen------- You are receiving this mail because: -------You are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee.-------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Spamassassin-devel mailing listSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel
First, it was my understanding that they had the food before theyrefused to pay.  I often have the goods in my possession before I settlethe paycheck.Second, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal inIndia.  It isn't far from stealing the only food my children have soI'll have to watch them starve.  The margin of survival is very, very,thin.So yes.  In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for alittle food' in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended tocause suffering if not death on the victims family.  That such an acttriggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired thefirst shot.With all of that said I still don't know if this happened or not.  Nordo I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendorswas that thin.> -----Original Message-----> From: Stephen D.

I haven't met an openssh like that and in worst case I've had 3> different openssl libraries (WTF can't they just bump a major version if> it's incompatible?!?).Strange... all my openssh packages don't explicitly requires a version ofopenssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hatpackage? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve yourproblem.What you need to know for openssl is :0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.00.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.10.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is onthose files and not on "openssl = version".Matthias-- Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 PlantaSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, SpainElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23_______________________________________________RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list
